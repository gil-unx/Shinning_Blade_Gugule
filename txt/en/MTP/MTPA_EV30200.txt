--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
Come on, have some food!
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Anika-san It's dangerous to run with a tray of food !
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
Oh dear... Wow!?
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
Acha...
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
What happened!?
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Annika, are you hurt? Hey, medic!
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Oh, uh...I just fell down...?
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
There's no need to call a medic, right?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
Don't worry about getting hurt!  Show me your scars!
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
An overturned meal is worse than an injury...
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
Food is mine
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
I'll clean up the mess. Go to the first aid tent!
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
Huh...Is it really ok?
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
I feel like it's becoming more important than it needs to be...
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Good shot...
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
There's more food to bring for the next mission...
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
That looks heavy, Amy If you have to do the heavy lifting, I'll help you!
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
Oh, Felix.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Are you carrying food?  Okay, leave it to me!
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Um, I've almost finished carrying it...
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
I brought four dozen!  Where should I put it?
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
4 dozen!? I-I don't need that many!
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Is that so?
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
I'm happy to help you, but I'm too excited!
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
Sorry...
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Ah, I don't want the next mission...sigh.
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Imperial forces that entered the canyon  Do you want me to destroy it?
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
There's no escape in the canyon, right?
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
It's like a minced meat maker.  I feel like I'm being thrown into it 
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Minced meat maker? That's a nice thing to say.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
It's no laughing matter!  I don't understand the horror of minced meat machines
at all!
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
Don't worry!  I'll destroy the minced meat machine !
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Destroying it... It's okay to be excited, though.  Please don't push yourself
too hard.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Number of meals to prepare  It is decreasing day by day.  Because it's
irresistible
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
As long as I'm here that won't happen and I won't let it happen!
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
That's a nice thing to say.  You, even in the regular army.  Is that how it was?
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Hey, Felix is  Was he a former regular soldier?  Why is it nameless again?
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
This is a violation of the order.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
I pointed out my superior's mistake and objected to the operation, and I was
sent here.
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
It's like you're acting like it's not your fault.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
It is true that for a soldier the commands of his superiors are absolute.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
But You die because of a mistake.  We are members, right?
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
It's all about life. If the captain is no good, It's hard.
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
That's right. There's nothing wrong with saying no to something that's no good.
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
What about my captain?
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Felix didn't approve of Kurt becoming captain.
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
I know you're good, but I wonder if you can trust me as a captain.
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
You put Amy in a dangerous place in the last battle, right?
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
I don't believe in that kind of thing.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
That's what a commander is all about You can't win just by avoiding risks 
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
I know!  But I don't want to accept command, putting my friends in danger 
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
I don't like it...!
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Don't get hung up on it Well, don't get mad like that.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
Drink some of my soup and relax.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Sorry, I can't... Don't worry about me There's nothing I can do!
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Damn it!!
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
That's why I'm weak!
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
The slope continues No matter how much I climb, there's no end to it.
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
This road is safer than the flat ground.
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
It's supposed to be safe. Even the Imperial Army doesn't want to pass on such a
tough road!
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
Wow!?
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
Snake! It's a snake!  Help me!
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
Julio!
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Where's the snake?
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
What's going on?
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
There was a snake I'm not good with snakes ...
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
If it was a snake, wouldn't it have run away already?  They are cowardly
creatures.
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Julio, were you bitten?  What about poison?  Is there an antidote?
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
There aren't many snakes with fangs that can penetrate military uniforms.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
I wasn't bitten. I was just startled and fell.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
Huh?　Itety... Did you damage your leg?
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
What!? Medic!  Julio is in trouble!
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Don't make a big deal I don't really care...
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Bring the thangka!  Julio has broken a bone!
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Don't do that!  It's just a little twist.
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Then Why are you sitting?
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
It's just that I'm a little tired... That's it!
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Serge! It's Thangka!
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
I don't need it!  It's not a big deal!
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
We still have to walk for a while, right?  If you force it it might get worse.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
You know, Even if you take care of me, you won't get more food, right?
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
I don't care about food!  I'm worried about your feet!
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
Don't make a fuss!  Everyone  They've all gathered, haven't they?
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
What's wrong with No.21?  Is there a problem?
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
Felix just asked me to have a big dinner.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Hey, Julio!
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Okay, shut up.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Hmm...I see.  Just right  Let's take a short break here.
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Troops, take a short break!
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Huh, good timing.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Maybe...  Julio's injury  Did you care?
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
The timing was just good More than that, №21
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
Huh, what?
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
Send scouts forward  You should go.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Understood!
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
Don't miss anything suspicious. On a mountain path like this, it's better to be
careful of snakes than enemies. 
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
I'll check again Are your legs okay?
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
It's okay!  It's not like I was shot. It's not like I was shot!
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
It would be fine if...
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
There can't be anything suspicious in a place like this...
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
Huh? Even though it's not raining, the ground is soft.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
No way... I'll try digging.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
You won!  The Imperial Army often goes this way.  You buried the mine!
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Now...what should we do?
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
There's a minefield ahead!
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Got it
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
What should I do?  There's a minefield in front of me  The Imperial Army is on
the other side.
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Continue to move forward With minimal removal of mines We will forcefully break
through the landmines.
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Wait!  This route is being guarded !
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
It's probably safer to take a different route!
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Then we'll be later than the Imperial Army in entering the canyon. We won't have
time to take a detour.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
But!
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
If you don't think the enemy will break through here, this is actually
convenient.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Don't be silly!  If damage occurs What are you planning to do?
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
We said we would clear the mines If we do it quickly and accurately we will get
the best results.
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
If we arrive late at the canyon, the Imperial Army will take the initiative.
That's our biggest concern.
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
I can at least see that what you say is just.
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
But!  I can't accept the way you don't prioritize the safety of the members !
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
...do not change course Break through the minefield
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Damn...
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
I don't understand!  That bastard That's so reckless!
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Think of it as Kurt.  I'm making a judgment.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
I'm not someone who does something reckless without thinking.  It's always been
like that, hasn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
I know that but...!
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
There is no safety in the punishment squad.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
Still...  I don't want everyone to die!
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Felix...
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
You're a nice guy.
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
He's too nice to be a soldier.
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
I...!
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
I'm a chef  I'm not going to talk about the war But...
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Isn't war about safety first and survival?
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Looking at Kurt's command  That's what I think.
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
Got it!  If this happens, I'll do it!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
It's fine as long as I protect everyone!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Huh?  How can it be like that!?
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
I really can't do this!  Whether it's a mine or an enemy, I won't let my friends
die!
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
Absolutely!
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
Felix has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 "Friendship Bonds" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
I won...  Is everyone safe?
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
Hey Felix  Are you alive?
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Gloria!  Looks like there are no injuries.
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Arriving at the site before the Imperial Army was the reason for our victory.
The captain's decision was correct.
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
I see. Maybe...
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
By the way, you and Giulio  Weren't you together?
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Julio isn't back yet! ?  ...Damn!
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Wait!  What are you planning to do!?
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
I'm sure you'll go find it!
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
Another Imperial force is approaching We don't have time to search!
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
You know what?
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
Felix!
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
Shit, my feet hurt...!
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
It's just as Felix said It got worse while I was running...
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
The enemy has arrived!  There's no point in crawling away ...
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
Sorry, guys.  I've already made some food. I don't think I'll be able to do
it...
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
Julio!
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
Felix!? You idiot!  Why did you come back?
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
Good!  You're alive!
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
Listen to what people have to say!  Don't worry about me, run away quickly!
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
Shut up, baggage!
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
Baggage!?
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
You can't walk, right?  I'll carry it home!  From now on, you're a burden!
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
Are you serious?! I'm not that light, am I?
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
Why did you think I trained in the military?  Don't insult the former regular
army!
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
I'll carry you. Are your legs hurting?
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
It's okay But you're stupid. You...
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
Okay, let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
That's ridiculous  Even though you complained about Kurt so much 
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
I hate doing things unreasonably.  But I'm being reckless.  It's okay!
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
I don't have any logic or clumsiness... anymore.
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
I lost my family in the last war. My parents, my siblings, and my grandfather.
--------------------------------
[00000174][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000175][none]
To me, my friends are family.
--------------------------------
[00000176][none]
I will always protect my family I decided that when I was a kid.
--------------------------------
[00000177][none]
Is that so...
--------------------------------
[00000178][none]
That's why you value your friends so much...
--------------------------------
[00000179][none]
Okay, let's fly!  Hold on tight!
--------------------------------
[00000180][none]
Hey!? Are you still getting faster!?
--------------------------------
[00000181][none]
I told you it's okay for me to be reckless!
--------------------------------
[00000182][none]
Ah, Felix-san is back!
--------------------------------
[00000183][none]
I'm running carrying Julio-san on my shoulders!
--------------------------------
[00000184][none]
Wow, that's a totally hopeless guy...
--------------------------------
[00000185][none]
Almost there, Julio!
--------------------------------
[00000186][none]
What kind of guy really managed to escape...!
--------------------------------
[00000187][none]
It's an easy win!  My friends are my source of strength!
--------------------------------
