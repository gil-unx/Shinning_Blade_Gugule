[00000001][none]
Tsk... Now you want to be on the front lines as a shock troop?
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
I guess you really think you can be replaced even if you die.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
But let's do our best We can't run away.
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
If we try hard, I'm sure he'll recognize us someday.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
Amy says nice things.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
It feels better to move toward hope than to mourn 
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
However, I understand the feeling of wanting to complain.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
I don't like this kind of unsmart fight either.
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
What do you dislike?  You call yourself a knight You're extremely weak!
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
In what world is there a picky night?  You fake knight!
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
I will  re-educate you into a fine knight !
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
Oh!  It tastes sharper than usual!  I feel like I'm about to wake up to
something!
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
When you wake up Wash your face and quickly Go on a special attack!
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
It's a waste of a beautiful woman to look so scary. Mademoiselle...
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Gyafu!?
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Knight be silent For the sake of my great Queen!  Declare and set out!
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
If you remain silent you won't be able to make a declaration...
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
Guahah!!
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
I have hell ears
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
As expected...
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
It looks really painful...
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Alphonse sounds good again. This...
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Love and heartlessness blend into one blow. This exquisite taste...
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
After all, Layla was born to become a queen.
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
That's right. My whip is the most effective in this world  against bad men.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Where on earth did you master this super technique...?
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
OK Let me tell you something special.
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
I acquired this ability to educate a certain man...
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
He was a helpless child who was very worth educating.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Please call me Homer He's my younger brother.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
My younger brother with this whip...!?
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
Don't get me wrong, I haven't done anything terrible.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Homer was very happy to be educated.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
In a sense, Maybe I was the one who was raised. ...Uhuh.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
What a brother and sister...!!
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Is this also a form of sister-brother love...?
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Is there a man out there who needs an education?
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Ugh... it's Layla!
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Those are the eyes of a wild eagle aiming at its prey. Don't make eye
contact...!
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
Oh,  Layla, are you taking a graceful walk in a place like this ?
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
Your mouth is sagging You need to be educated on this...
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
That idiot... he did it.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
It's sloppy!  Alphonse!
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Ha!? My plump cheeks look like the blazing morning sun...
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
It's intense...
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Your face is careless, your face!
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
I'll cheer you up Come here, you funushi!!
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Hehehe... I'm honored to be inspired by such a beautiful woman. 
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Isn't he really awake to something?
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
However, thanks to her, the morale of the men in the squad has improved
strangely.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
There is no so-called demon sergeant in this unit.
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Maybe we're happy because a beautiful woman is playing that role.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
...Huh!? Where is this?
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
Oh, are you awake?
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
My memory is flying. What happened?
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Oh, you know The 10th shot was a bad sight and I got carried away.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
I don't remember anything after the 7th shot... I guess it's okay.
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
That's how sweet the kiss you gave me
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Oh, I still had time to make a joke like that.
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
In that case, should I give you more kisses?
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
...No, I'll save your wake-up kiss with care.
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
More than that, Layla You have a unique nobility.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
Where was that cultivated?
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Born with it.
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
I'm not from Gaul, I'm a human being who stands on top of the world.
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Why this Nameless?
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
I just educated the cocky guy a little bit.
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
A cocky man is...
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Company commander of the volunteer army. Was that paramecium a major?
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Company commander!? Major!?
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
He really was a helpless man.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
The second thing you said was that the commands of superiors are absolute and
you intimidate your subordinates.
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
I was trying to threaten a volunteer girl and order her to come to my room
tonight.
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
I put it in as hard as I could !
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
I was able to get away with sending it without a name...
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
It seems like your memory has skipped a beat. But for some reason, when you see
me, your face turns pale.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
So, I'm happy to go nameless.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
That's amazing...
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
That unconventional courage As noble as it seems...
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
That way of life that doesn't please anyone I think it's very beautiful.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
Start the battle now
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
As a frontline unit, we can never lose.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
I will fight till the end
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
There's no escape now We have no choice but to do it.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
You win!  That's the duty of the unit I'm in.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Layla, how are you doing?
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Don't talk to me I'm concentrating.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Don't say that You and I aren't close...
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
...squid!?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Before you talk nonsense, be more serious about winning 
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
For me, this one shot is the source of my concentration.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Huh... now you understand the way education is done.
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
But it's unusual to see you so concentrated.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
It's not that unusual.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
I just understand that today's battle is important.
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
Wow...seriously?
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
I want to realize a peaceful world as soon as possible.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
Peace?  Another unexpected word popped out 
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
I'm very serious
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
A world of peace and no war Don't you think that would be wonderful ?
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
Layla...
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Your eyes are so beautiful right now.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
What, are you saying you're not always pretty?
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
No, I've finally realized its beauty.
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
It seems like you needed some education to realize this by now.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Seriously, men don't have the eyes to see. Who is this guy...
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
She just doesn't seem like a queen.
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Regardless of social status The integrity of the soul is real.
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
As expected There's nothing wrong with my eyes 
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Leila has awakened to her potential @fcFF008800 "Ruler of the World" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
The enemy's base has been destroyed, but it looks like they still want to fight.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
This is a well-defended unit. They quickly regained their stance. 
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
I wish there was some way to disrupt the other party's pace...
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Ah... already!! I'm so irritated!!
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
Layla?
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
Still sluggish!  I'll do something about it!!
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
Layla!! It's dangerous if you jump out!
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
W-what!? A woman is coming here by herself!?
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
It might be some kind of trap!  Let's see what happens!
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Notice to all soldiers of the Imperial Army!  Drop your weapons surrender to
me!!
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Surrender!?
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
Stupid!  The battle is about to begin !
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
What is it?  Retract your limbs like a turtle. It's so ugly!
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
I get irritated when I see such useless men!
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
What are you talking about!?
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Come out!! I'll use this whip to show you what a soldier is!
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
That woman... You can say whatever you want...
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Don't deal with me!  If we keep here There's nothing we can do anyway.
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
Are you just withdrawing?  Does that mean there are only Noroma and cowards in
the Imperial Army?
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
Well, let's be clear here!
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
The cool Maximilian and Layla-sama!
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Which one do you want to serve Answer!
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
What...!?
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
If you follow such a war idiot, you'll be absorbed in war until you die!
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
Follow me!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
I will create a world without war for you all!!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Is that woman insane?
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Please bring Maximilian here.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
I'll re-educate that war idiot to be a peace idiot!
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
I can't forgive you... for insulting His Highness this much!
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Wait, this is a provocation!  Don't leave your post!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
It's gone!?
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
In a standoff, if you show an opening, you lose!  Don't take another shot!
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Wow!!
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Stupid, stupid!
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
Charge!  We'll destroy the enemy's formation!
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Wait, what?!  I haven't heard their reply yet!
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
You know it when you see it, right?  All enemies surrender to Layla.
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
It was a bit unreasonable, but Layla, it's your fault.
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
What's your credit? I didn't destroy it.
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
I was about to increase the number of my servants !
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
By any chance, what you just said wasn't a provocation...?
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
I'm sure you're serious.
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
...Seriously?
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
We were supposed to be one step closer to world peace. Don't get in the way!
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
What does it mean that the world becomes peaceful when the number of servants
increases...?
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
Educate men all over the world to serve me.
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
If I do that, my ideal peaceful world will be born.
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
mine, by me for my servants absolute queenship
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
This is my idea!
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
Are you seriously saying that...?
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
not obvious
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
As expected She's the queen I expected The scale is huge...
--------------------------------
