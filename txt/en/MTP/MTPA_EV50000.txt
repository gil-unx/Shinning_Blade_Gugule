[00000000][none]
Start the operation now
--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
There's no need to worry Please remain calm.
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
When finishing the action, crouch down on a sandbag to reduce the area hit by
the attack.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
The basics are important Don't forget
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
You defeated the enemy. I'll keep going like this.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
Don't leave a weakened enemy alone The basic strategy is to kill them all at
once 
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
If you reduce the number of enemies, you can definitely reduce your military
strength 
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Don't be shy. Target wounded and weak soldiers first.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Good
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
I was able to hit the enemy in the back.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
We are not ready to intercept Now is our best chance to attack.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
I'll attack all at once Don't be late!
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
Look, that's the enemy's base.
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
From now on, we head to conquer that base.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
The mission this time is not to defeat the enemy but to seize the base.
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Don't forget that Now start taking action
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
№6, can you hear me?  This has arrived at the designated location 
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Advance and attack enemy troops.
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
This is No.6 I understand.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
№13, are you ready?  Not a single enemy will escape We will definitely kill
them.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Yes... If you run away, you shouldn't do it, right?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Yes, to prevent the reconnaissance unit from bringing back the information.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
№1, if the enemy escapes, I'll ask.
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
What's wrong with No.1?  Reply
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
...no
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
nothing I know
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
What?  Hey, №6 What's going on with №1?
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
Don't worry, №7 №1 won't let the enemy escape.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
In fact, you and No. 13 should be careful not to make mistakes 
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
……!
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
This unit...!
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Tell each member Please confirm the main points of this battle 
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Currently, we are targeting this tank.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
Other enemy soldiers can be ignored.
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Prioritize destroying the target 
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Tanks and anti-tank soldiers move to this area others provide support.
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
I'm the anti-tank soldier No. 32, I'm heading for the tank.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
No.24!  I will support you!
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
№13, me too...
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
Each person must be aware of their own role and act accordingly. That's the
basis of unit combat.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
Operation begins, No. 13
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
Yes...
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Are you that dissatisfied with teaming up with me?
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
No!  What if something were to happen to No. 7...
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
...you don't be rude.
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
Huh!?
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
You must be very confident in yourself to worry about the members of your
team...
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Either they feel they can not rely on the other person.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
Ah...!!
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Well, that's fine Let's prove it while we erase your "Reaper" jinx.
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
The man who will be the captain of this squad is someone you should trust.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Trust...?
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
More evidence than argument Let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Fast...!  His attacks are highly accurate. There is no waste...
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Is this the No. 1 ability?
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Where did you learn such fighting skills at such a young age?
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
She will definitely be the main force of this unit.
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
I have to think of a way to get them to accept the command no matter what...
--------------------------------
[00000061][ホブゴブリン,ホブゴブリン,ホブゴブリン]
№7, can you hear me?  We can launch an attack at any time 
--------------------------------
[00000062][ホブゴブリン,ホブゴブリン,ホブゴブリン]
Give me a signal when you're ready.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
If the start of action is delayed any longer, it will be at a disadvantage.
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Our tank isn't ready in time but it seems we have no choice but to do it 
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Second Lieutenant Gunther Start action Unit 422 will also start.
--------------------------------
[00000066][ホブゴブリン,ホブゴブリン,ホブゴブリン]
All right. This is the enemy's flank. We'll attack with cross fire!
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
Understood!
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
As a result, the enemy was pulled in...
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Ensign Gunter probably predicted this situation and moved his troops.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
I thought he seemed like an easy-going guy, but he turns out to be a terrible
strategist.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
Oh, there were enemy formations on the flanks as well.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
This position will expose you to crossfire 
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
It's most effective on the plains. It's not much of a threat in the woods.
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
But it's better than a weak soldier who turns his tail and runs away, or a
reckless fool.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
You should be glad that you met someone with whom you can fight at least a
little.
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Certainly, it's more convenient for us.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
...That's what it is.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Start taking action but don't rush to achieve success.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Notify everyone Break through the enemy's encirclement and head to that point.
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
Our role is to protect Prince Borgia.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
Prioritize the protection of your armored vehicle and repel the approaching
enemy.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
Captain Thank you very much.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
May Valkyria's blessings be upon you all.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
Eliminate enemy anti-tank soldiers and tanks targeting armored vehicles as a
priority.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
Let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Notify everyone Break through the enemy's encirclement and head to that point.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Our role is to protect Prince Borgia.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Prioritize the protection of your armored vehicle and repel the approaching
enemy.
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Captain Thank you very much.
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
May Valkyria's blessings be upon you all.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Eliminate enemy anti-tank soldiers and tanks targeting armored vehicles as a
priority.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000093][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
What!? Are those black-clad soldiers the Gallic army?
--------------------------------
[00000094][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
Wait... those clothes look familiar...
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
We are a special task force of the Gallic army.
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
By order of someone I will eliminate the Imperial Army from now on.
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
All you vigilantes, please retreat without forcing yourself.
--------------------------------
[00000098][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
That person...
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
Help now Don't die
--------------------------------
[00000100][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000101][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
Yay!  The Imperial Army is now...
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Wait...!
--------------------------------
[00000103][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
That's...!
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Apparently that's the main force of the enemy force.
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
Notify everyone!  Change the mission objective!  Aim at the commander of the
enemy unit.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Hitting the commander will destroy the unit!  Let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000107][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
...That's amazing You made a calm decision without panicking 
--------------------------------
[00000108][サクヤ,マキシマ,サクヤ]
Me too... I'll definitely survive!
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
The victory condition has been changed to
@fcFFFF4640 ``Destroy the enemy commanded medium tank'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Well, the initial response is faster than the other day's engagement.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
It seems that the training level of the troops has improved 
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
But a complete surprise attack is something that no one, no matter how elite,
can survive.
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Now, how long should we keep it?
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
That is the main gate.
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
Confirmed ... Cosette, do you really want to take part in the battle?
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
...Yes I also want to take back Yuel City!
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
I can fight because I learned it in military training at school. Don't worry!
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
...I understand but please don't push yourself too hard.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
Yes!  Thank you!
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Gallia army!? Why from such a place...!?
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
You guys in the garrison Don't be too cautious!
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Okay Let's attack them... Now that I think about it...
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
As a reserve unit, you were told to retreat to the back.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Let me see how much power they have 
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
That is the main gate.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
Confirmed ... Cosette, do you really want to take part in the battle?
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
...Yes I also want to take back Yuel City!
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
I can fight because I learned it in military training at school. Don't worry!
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
...I understand but please don't push yourself too hard.
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
Yes!  Thank you!
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
Gallia army!? Why from such a place...!?
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
You guys in the garrison Don't be too cautious!
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Okay Let's attack them... Now that I think about it...
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
As a reserve unit, you were told to retreat to the back.
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Let me see how much power they have 
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
I will definitely stop them!!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
Calm down, Avan!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Can you stay calm?  We can't forgive anyone who attacks this town, which has no
military facilities!
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Listen, Take a good look at the tank in front of you.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
What do you think will happen if you let your emotions go and rush into it? What
do you think will happen?
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
Ugh...
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
If you want to fight I won't stop you.
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
But if you're going to fight, you'll have to cooperate with my plan to fight
that monster.
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
...I understand. It's true that I can't do anything about it alone.
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Okay. There's no chance of winning if you go head-on  against a giant tank.
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Control the enemy bases around you while keeping the tanks in check.
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
If you can stop the supply of ammunition and power, no matter how big you are,
you will have no power.
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Got it!
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Do you think that just one platoon will do anything?  This Ejidna-chan!
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
If you lick me, I'll step on you!
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
This base doesn't seem to be designed to be attacked.
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
The security is very lax. I don't think it would be difficult to break in.
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
that's convenient
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
But it's never better to be careful.
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
That's right That's why they attack from two directions at the same time to
cause confusion.
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
Leave it to us With the new power we have completed We must produce results.
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
Okay We'll carry out the operation quickly We'll evacuate to Gaul territory.
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
Prioritize speed to avoid calling in reinforcements.
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
no problem
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
Now, let's start the operation.
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
Defeat the enemies approaching your base!
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
Do not tolerate the Empire's tyrannical use of force!
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
Are you going to take command?
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
I am in charge of the cadets.
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
I am responsible for leading this battle to victory.
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
I don't know how good of a commander you are, but...
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
Please remember that I am always ready to command your troops if you are
incompetent.
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
...Reliable.
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
In that case, I'll set a good example for you.
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
This... It's a pretty solid defense.
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
A powerful pillbox is deployed 
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
Sergeant Hardens, please prioritize the destruction of pillboxes.
--------------------------------
[00000174][none]
Understood The infantry opponent asked!
--------------------------------
[00000175][none]
Of course
--------------------------------
[00000176][none]
Okay! Drop it all at once!
--------------------------------
[00000177][none]
What's wrong?  Are you planning to die here?
--------------------------------
[00000178][none]
There is no one in this unit who will fight to the death!
--------------------------------
[00000179][none]
Then defeat me.
--------------------------------
[00000180][none]
...The only people who take advantage of provocation are th those who do not
know the value of life.
--------------------------------
[00000181][none]
Huh... that's a good answer.
--------------------------------
[00000182][none]
Everyone, focus on defense!  This is not the place for us to die!
--------------------------------
[00000183][none]
This... It's a pretty solid defense.
--------------------------------
[00000184][none]
A powerful pillbox is deployed 
--------------------------------
[00000185][none]
Sergeant Hardens, please prioritize the destruction of pillboxes.
--------------------------------
[00000186][none]
Understood The infantry opponent asked!
--------------------------------
[00000187][none]
Of course
--------------------------------
[00000188][none]
Okay! Drop it all at once!
--------------------------------
[00000189][none]
To raise the drawbridge you must move the device at that point 
--------------------------------
[00000190][none]
As expected, the defense is very strict.
--------------------------------
[00000191][none]
We must attack in cooperation with the detached force led by Imka.
--------------------------------
[00000192][none]
How this works too It's difficult.
--------------------------------
[00000193][none]
We will attack from the front so that the detached unit will not be isolated.
--------------------------------
[00000194][none]
Understood
--------------------------------
[00000195][none]
Is that a Gallic army unit?  I had no idea you had come this far ...
--------------------------------
[00000196][none]
Hmm, that's interesting Let's see how it goes.
--------------------------------
[00000197][none]
That tank is the commander's machine If we destroy it, this unit should
collapse.
--------------------------------
[00000198][none]
To everyone, we'll concentrate our attacks on that large plane!
--------------------------------
[00000199][none]
Did you come...?
--------------------------------
[00000200][none]
Savagery is not true courage You should know that!
--------------------------------
[00000201][none]
I couldn't show my true feelings in Yuel City, so I'll let you compete this
time!
--------------------------------
[00000202][none]
Nameless!  Show us your power!
--------------------------------
[00000203][none]
Let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000204][none]
What happened to the tank?  Gusurg, report!
--------------------------------
[00000205][none]
It's tough, Captain!  Mr. Gusrug is not inside the tank!
--------------------------------
[00000206][none]
What!? Where is Gusurg !?
--------------------------------
[00000207][none]
Mr. Gusrug's uniform jacket is placed in the cockpit!
--------------------------------
[00000208][none]
Also, the tank's main gun barrel is broken...!
--------------------------------
[00000209][none]
You're such an idiot...!
--------------------------------
[00000210][none]
Start attacking now!  Nameless Take the lead with artillery fire!
--------------------------------
[00000211][none]
Wait!  The tank is in trouble Cannot fire!
--------------------------------
[00000212][none]
What are you talking about?  Shoot quickly!  You want the enemy to take the
lead!
--------------------------------
[00000213][none]
Bombing is not possible!  Start the battle!
--------------------------------
[00000214][none]
Yeah, you're useless!!
--------------------------------
[00000215][none]
Damn! The enemy has arrived!!
--------------------------------
[00000216][none]
To be behind the curve... How dare you!
--------------------------------
[00000217][none]
Damn, I'd like to go to support the regular army, but that's not the point...!
--------------------------------
[00000218][none]
To everyone!  We will defend the base in this area to the death!
--------------------------------
[00000219][none]
If we are defeated here, the entire army will collapse!  Hold on!
--------------------------------
[00000220][none]
Riera! Can you hear me!
--------------------------------
[00000221][none]
No, I can't hear you!
--------------------------------
[00000222][none]
Still, it seems like you have the will to fight the enemy. You understand,
Captain?
--------------------------------
[00000223][none]
...Ah We need her power to break the siege 
--------------------------------
[00000224][none]
Break the siege using Riela's attack as a starting point!
--------------------------------
[00000225][none]
Imuka Thank you very much!
--------------------------------
[00000226][none]
...not possible
--------------------------------
[00000227][none]
Imuka...?
--------------------------------
[00000228][none]
Impossible!  That's... It's the devil...!!
--------------------------------
[00000229][none]
Hey Imka!  What's wrong?
--------------------------------
[00000230][none]
Uh... Uh...!!
--------------------------------
[00000231][none]
Damn, I can't help it!  We'll go alone!
--------------------------------
[00000232][none]
What power...
--------------------------------
[00000233][none]
Are you controlling the power of Ragnite itself, not guns or cannons?
--------------------------------
[00000234][none]
That... The power of Valkyria!
--------------------------------
[00000235][none]
The Gallic army...I don't think they care about us...!
--------------------------------
[00000236][none]
There are a lot of them... I don't think they'll give me an easy fight 
--------------------------------
[00000237][none]
That's a lot of room for words, isn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000238][none]
You're the one who can't enjoy it. I don't mind that kind of number 
--------------------------------
[00000239][none]
I'm fine too!  Now that I'm asleep, I'm feeling 100 times more energetic now
that I'm feeling tired!
--------------------------------
[00000240][none]
Don't push yourself In an emergency, just leave it to yourself There's no
problem
--------------------------------
[00000241][none]
In case of an emergency Imka is there, I can do whatever I want.
--------------------------------
[00000242][none]
You... I don't like that way of thinking.
--------------------------------
[00000243][none]
Well, let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000244][none]
Oh!  I won't let you slip!
--------------------------------
[00000245][none]
That's strange The attack style is different from the previous Calamity.
--------------------------------
[00000246][none]
I'm not the type to rely on momentum, or to play games with others...
--------------------------------
[00000247][none]
It's a solid fighting style that's more like a standard tactic.
--------------------------------
[00000248][none]
That tank is probably the commander's plane.
--------------------------------
[00000249][none]
I expected it, but he's really tough. Kurt...
--------------------------------
[00000250][none]
But this battle is also the way I wanted it to be!
--------------------------------
[00000251][none]
Fast...!  Mobility Has it been further refined?
--------------------------------
[00000252][none]
I didn't expect it to exceed my expected speed of action.
--------------------------------
[00000253][none]
They're growing rapidly ...they're becoming a troublesome force.
--------------------------------
[00000254][none]
Are you aiming here after all?
--------------------------------
[00000255][none]
Huh... The Gallic army completely outmaneuvered us.
--------------------------------
[00000256][none]
I was really surprised that a group of troops who were on the run would show up
here.
--------------------------------
[00000257][none]
But, with such a small number of people, can we protect this landgriz?
--------------------------------
[00000258][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000259][none]
Just like here, Calamity also has little strength.
--------------------------------
[00000260][none]
Since it was a surprise attack the target of the attack should have been
narrowed down...
--------------------------------
[00000261][none]
It is unlikely that Captain Dachau would attack civilians indiscriminately.
--------------------------------
[00000262][none]
Even considering the troop placement, the aim is to break through the center
from this castle gate.
--------------------------------
[00000263][none]
Tell each member!  We will gather our forces at the castle gates and concentrate
on defense!
--------------------------------
[00000264][none]
But that won't protect the citizens!
--------------------------------
[00000265][none]
Imka, what do you think?
--------------------------------
[00000266][none]
If that man hasn't given up his pride in Darcus, he won't touch the citizens.
--------------------------------
[00000267][none]
I agree with you Notify everyone again!  Defending the castle gate is the top
priority!
--------------------------------
[00000268][none]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000269][none]
That's not good. The damage to the castle gate is getting bigger. 
--------------------------------
[00000270][none]
To everyone!  Hit the enemy attacking the castle gate!
--------------------------------
[00000271][none]
At this rate, the castle gate will be broken down!
--------------------------------
[00000272][none]
I'm sorry, but any idiot who comes at me will cry.
--------------------------------
[00000273][none]
...I won't forgive you even if you cry, never!
--------------------------------
[00000274][none]
You should know that they're not just charging in without a plan, right?
--------------------------------
[00000275][none]
I'm saying that I'll crush every plan!
--------------------------------
[00000276][none]
Don't do anything unnecessary and hold me back!
--------------------------------
[00000277][none]
If there is someone who is more wary of Nameless than me, I would like to know.
--------------------------------
[00000278][none]
Mouth without diminishing!  Come on, let's destroy it!
--------------------------------
[00000279][none]
Understood!
--------------------------------
[00000280][none]
Nameless is here!
--------------------------------
[00000281][none]
Valkyria!  I will kill you and offer your head to Lord Dahau!
--------------------------------
[00000282][none]
To achieve independence... Let's go ooooooooo!
--------------------------------
[00000283][none]
This abnormally high morale... Sergeant Hardens is having a hard time 
--------------------------------
[00000284][none]
Listen, don't give up!  You'll be defeated at once!
--------------------------------
[00000285][none]
Don't be isolated Let's work together to attack!
--------------------------------
[00000286][none]
Nameless... Did you come after all?
--------------------------------
[00000287][none]
But... Valkyria will be defeated!
--------------------------------
[00000288][none]
With this Ejidna's firepower, I will definitely kill it!
--------------------------------
[00000289][none]
Huge tank...!  That's Calamity's main force.
--------------------------------
[00000290][none]
We can't afford to lose here!  Everyone, let's do our best!
--------------------------------
[00000291][none]
Even though it's heavily armored there must be a weak point somewhere If you aim
there...!
--------------------------------
[00000292][none]
Kurt!  Look over there!  There's a radiator!
--------------------------------
[00000293][none]
It's that big There must be several radiators 
--------------------------------
[00000294][none]
The question is which part of the radiator...
--------------------------------
[00000295][none]
There is no doubt that those two vessels over there are structurally used to
cool the main gun.
--------------------------------
[00000296][none]
Can you stop the main gun by destroying it?
--------------------------------
[00000297][none]
As long as you stop the main gun, an all-out attack at close range is possible.
--------------------------------
[00000298][none]
Aim for that radiator!   Spread out and attack while scattering the main gun
targets!
--------------------------------
[00000299][none]
Hmm, one radiator was damaged...!
--------------------------------
[00000300][none]
I didn't expect you to attack with such high accuracy... Don't do it!
--------------------------------
[00000301][none]
Infantry!  Hurry up to intercept!
--------------------------------
[00000302][none]
Okay, we've destroyed one of the radiators!
--------------------------------
[00000303][none]
Destroy the other one too!  Then the main gun stops!  Please, everyone!
--------------------------------
[00000304][none]
I'll take the lead and destroy the enemy's formation!
--------------------------------
[00000305][none]
Enemies scattered left and right I'll leave it to everyone!
--------------------------------
[00000306][none]
Understood!  Leave the center to Riera. We'll aim for both wings!
--------------------------------
[00000307][none]
With this power... I'll help you this time!
--------------------------------
[00000308][none]
Here they come Eisler's henchmen
--------------------------------
[00000309][none]
Looks like you're fully prepared to intercept It won't be easy to break through 
--------------------------------
[00000310][none]
I know
--------------------------------
[00000311][none]
I'm talking about the cool Eisler The child care unit is probably gathering the
best of the best.
--------------------------------
[00000312][none]
I wouldn't bother calling you if I was dealing with you.
--------------------------------
[00000313][none]
So let's check the strategy again 
--------------------------------
[00000314][none]
Commander Crowe's armored vehicle heads for a location out of reach of the
enemy.
--------------------------------
[00000315][none]
If you can escape this far, you'll be safe.
--------------------------------
[00000316][none]
As soon as we arrive We will shake it off with the movement speed that 422nd
Unit is proud of 
--------------------------------
[00000317][none]
That's a reasonable decision. When it comes to legs, there's no unit that can
compete with yours .
--------------------------------
[00000318][none]
I was chased a lot, so I'm confident in my ability to run away.
--------------------------------
[00000319][none]
Everyone, let's start acting!
--------------------------------
[00000320][none]
Conquer the first base Okay, that's it.
--------------------------------
[00000321][none]
Hey, there's no time to be happy I don't have time Let's get this over with
quickly.
--------------------------------
[00000322][none]
Understood Everyone, please continue to take control of the enemy base as
quickly as possible.
--------------------------------
[00000323][none]
Conquer the second base There's only one thing left!
--------------------------------
[00000324][none]
Let's break through quickly Don't give Eisler's bastard any time!
--------------------------------
[00000325][none]
We don't have time Hurry up!
--------------------------------
[00000326][none]
However, no one knows that there was another national rescue squad behind the
scenes.
--------------------------------
[00000327][none]
This is all you can do with complete covert action.
--------------------------------
[00000328][none]
From here on, we must also consider the possibility of engagement 
--------------------------------
[00000329][none]
If it doesn't proceed as efficiently as possible with the minimum necessary...
--------------------------------
[00000330][none]
Think carefully Be careful and be bold...
--------------------------------
[00000331][none]
Yes, just like Kurt...!
--------------------------------
[00000332][none]
Nameless... I know very well that you guys are strong 
--------------------------------
[00000333][none]
But... don't think that you can defeat me easily!
--------------------------------
[00000334][none]
Humans can do anything if they want to die!
--------------------------------
[00000335][none]
No matter who you're up against, there's no need to be scared!
--------------------------------
[00000336][none]
Look, Gusrug...
--------------------------------
[00000337][none]
I'll prove to you that you were right to turn me into an object!
--------------------------------
[00000338][none]
Let's win this battle Kurt!
--------------------------------
[00000339][none]
I put all my heart and soul into it as a man who even gave up his pride as
Darcus!
--------------------------------
[00000340][none]
I say this to everyone Regardless of whether we win or lose We will end up here.
--------------------------------
[00000341][none]
Don't be afraid of death Don't be afraid of defeat!  Good!
--------------------------------
[00000342][none]
Kurt, that...!
--------------------------------
[00000343][none]
You might be able to stop the tank by destroying the engine's radiator!
--------------------------------
[00000344][none]
Communicate to each member!  Concentrated attack on the engine radiator!
--------------------------------
[00000345][none]
With our hands... We will protect Landgriz!
--------------------------------
[00000346][none]
I am the only one who can fulfill Lord Dahau's ideals... My long-cherished
desire for independence !
--------------------------------
[00000347][none]
Gusrug! Lydia!  I'll shoulder your regrets as well!
--------------------------------
[00000348][none]
My brethren have returned to the sky!  Please lend me your strength!
--------------------------------
[00000349][none]
It's a game!  Nameless!
--------------------------------
[00000350][none]
Gaul too!  The Empire and the Federation too!  Yugd religion too!
--------------------------------
[00000351][none]
Nothing can stop me from building a new nation!
--------------------------------
[00000352][none]
It's for everyone... A country that makes everyone happy!
--------------------------------
[00000353][none]
All Darxians except me!
--------------------------------
[00000354][none]
All who resist will be burned down!
--------------------------------
[00000355][none]
It is said that in ancient times, 100 cities and 1 million people and animals
were burned down.
--------------------------------
[00000356][none]
Let me recreate the disaster of Darcus!
--------------------------------
[00000357][none]
But if it creates a nation of Darcus that will last for a thousand years, then
that's what I want!
--------------------------------
[00000358][none]
It will be a message to the ancestors of our fallen brethren!
--------------------------------
[00000359][none]
I broke all the radiators!
--------------------------------
[00000360][none]
This will stop ballistic weapons, right?
--------------------------------
[00000361][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000362][none]
Unfortunately... As long as that interceptor is present, it will not stop
starting.
--------------------------------
[00000363][none]
Dahau!!
--------------------------------
[00000364][none]
I can't let Darcus' hope disappear 
--------------------------------
[00000365][none]
What you are about to do will destroy the world!
--------------------------------
[00000366][none]
There is hope on the other side of destruction!
--------------------------------
[00000367][none]
It's like Darcus's  hideous history began with destruction!
--------------------------------
[00000368][none]
Dahau...!
--------------------------------
[00000369][none]
...I'll stop it!
--------------------------------
[00000370][none]
The way to stop sadness is not to burden others with your sadness!
--------------------------------
[00000371][none]
...Ah
--------------------------------
[00000372][none]
Guys, we don't have time!  Concentrate attack on that interceptor!
--------------------------------
[00000373][none]
And... We will defeat Dahau!  Thank you!
--------------------------------
[00000374][none]
The victory condition has been changed to
@fcFFFF4640 ``Defeating the intruder interception device'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000375][none]
Gaul too!  The Empire and the Federation too!  Yugd religion too!
--------------------------------
[00000376][none]
Nothing can stop me from building a new nation!
--------------------------------
[00000377][none]
It's for everyone... A country that makes everyone happy!
--------------------------------
[00000378][none]
All Darxians except me!
--------------------------------
[00000379][none]
All who resist will be burned down!
--------------------------------
[00000380][none]
It is said that in ancient times, 100 cities and 1 million people and animals
were burned down.
--------------------------------
[00000381][none]
Let me recreate the disaster of Darcus!
--------------------------------
[00000382][none]
But if it creates a nation of Darcus that will last for a thousand years, then
that's what I want!
--------------------------------
[00000383][none]
It will be a handout to the scattered compatriots ancestors!
--------------------------------
[00000384][none]
Destroyed all the radiators. Now... The ballistic weapons will stop.
--------------------------------
[00000385][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000386][none]
Unfortunately... As long as that interceptor is present, it will not stop
starting.
--------------------------------
[00000387][none]
Dahau!!
--------------------------------
[00000388][none]
I can't let Darcus' hope disappear 
--------------------------------
[00000389][none]
What you are trying to do will only cause death and destruction!
--------------------------------
[00000390][none]
This era was built on the corpses of us Dalxians!
--------------------------------
[00000391][none]
If we call that the prosperity of humanity, then we have the right to do so too!
--------------------------------
[00000392][none]
Dahau...!!
--------------------------------
[00000393][none]
No matter how many sins I carry I can't bear the sadness of losing a loved
one...
--------------------------------
[00000394][none]
So...!  There can be no hope on a mountain of dead bodies of innocent people!
--------------------------------
[00000395][none]
...Ah
--------------------------------
[00000396][none]
Guys, we don't have time!  Concentrate attack on that interceptor!
--------------------------------
[00000397][none]
And... We will defeat Dahau!  Thank you!
--------------------------------
[00000398][none]
That's stupid!  The attack isn't working!?
--------------------------------
[00000399][none]
I can't die Kurt Irving
--------------------------------
[00000400][none]
That's... impossible... A person's will can transcend even death...
--------------------------------
[00000401][none]
You don't understand Even if I die, I still have ideals that I want to fulfill.
--------------------------------
[00000402][none]
Until you get it Even death won't forgive There is hope.
--------------------------------
[00000403][none]
Captain Dachau... You!
--------------------------------
[00000404][none]
I can't stop it now!!
--------------------------------
[00000405][none]
Alright, we've arrived at our destination, the armory.
--------------------------------
[00000406][none]
Looks like you fell for the false information Lieutenant Irving.
--------------------------------
[00000407][none]
Captain Dahau!? Damn, it was a trap!
--------------------------------
[00000408][none]
Come on, let's put an end to our relationship here!
--------------------------------
[00000409][none]
Damn... I'll break through somehow!
--------------------------------
[00000410][none]
Captain Dachau I will beat you!  I'll show you victory!!
--------------------------------
[00000411][none]
The victory condition has been changed to
@fcFFFF4640 "Achieve the target point in Area 1" @fci.
