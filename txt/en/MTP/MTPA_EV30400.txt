--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
Okay, all you have to do is set up the camp and it's time to rest!
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
One more effort!
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
...Why do we have to set up the regular army's camp?
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
I'm not convinced either but I guess I can't help it.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
It's still better to do chores than to have to do crazy special attacks in
battle 
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
What is the regular army I can't do it...
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
You guys!  Don't slack off!
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
It's an honor to help the Regular Army with their work!
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
Tsk...!
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
Hey, you there
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
...what?
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
What kind of attitude is that?
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
You're so cocky!
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
What...what are you doing!
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Because they take a rebellious attitude 
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Daruxians like you need discipline!
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Gah...!
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
You guys just shut up and listen to us!
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Wait!  I'll apologize on your behalf, so stop it!
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Damn it...!
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Are you okay? №56 Do you want to go to the first aid tent?
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Why do you protect the Darxians?
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
What's wrong with worrying about your friends?
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
The Darcus people are your friends!? Aren't you stupid?
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
I guess it's nameless because you're an idiot.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Hey...don't worry about it. If you're following the diagram, even the regular
army...!
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Ha, you big idiot!  If you mess with us, you'll be shot!
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Hahaha!  There's nothing I can do!
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
Oh no...!
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Hey there everyone!  Work when you're busy  Please do not increase it!
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
For those of you in the regular army, please refrain from delaying setting up
camp.
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
If this continues any longer, I will report it to the unit commander ?
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Ke!
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Then do it quickly!  Don't slack off!
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
...Who is this guy?  You're doing unnecessary things.
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Did you go... Hey, No.56 Are you hurt?
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Don't worry about me...
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Mr. №56...
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Shit, why am I  in this place ...!
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
It's awfully quiet... Are the Regular Army guys reducing the number of guards ?
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
No matter how dominant you are, you cut corners like this...
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
We're fighting a war Do you want to win...?
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
With this level of vigilance, even I could easily...
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
Good luck!  It's time to change the lookout!
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Hmm... №32?
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
What's wrong? You look serious. Are you hungry?
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
nothing
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
...It seems you were beaten by the regular army guys Are you okay?
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
It's nothing like that. I got used to it a long time ago.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
To be beaten?
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
There are no Darxians who would make a fuss just by being hit.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Then why do you look so gloomy?
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
It has nothing to do with you!
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Well, if you don't want to say it, I won't force you to ask.
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
But I like bright faces better than dark faces.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Both of you!  What are you doing?  Is there something wrong with your advice?
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Hey, Amy Are you talking about men?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
...Do you know?
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
The takeover of the guard was slow, so I got curious and came to take a look.
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
Mr. №56, please come back soon and rest.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
...leave me alone.
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
……№56-san  You've been acting strange lately, haven't you?
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Is this something you are worried about?
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Children cannot understand
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
I guess you're worried after all...
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Why am I on Nameless...?
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Volunteer for the volunteer army?  I shouldn't have done it...
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Because I'm a Darcusian That's the only reason I was sent nameless...!
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
Damn it!  Is there such a stupid story?
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
I haven't done anything that would warrant punishment!
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Oh, go home already...
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
The next mission is in the desert, right?
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
You look happy Valerie-san
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
There are ruins in the desert If you have time Maybe you can go investigate.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
A chase in the desert isn't that easy.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
The desert is hell Once the water runs out, it's over.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
So be prepared!  That's right!
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
Yes, you are the girl.  You're a solid person.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
It gets cold at night in the desert, right?  We need to increase the number of
blankets.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
You know better.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
Valerie is also an apprentice. If you focus on your studies, you won't have
anyone to marry.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
If you're single, it's not very convincing, is it?
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
I've never had a problem with men, even now.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Gloria-san is dependable.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
I also want to be that kind of woman.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Absolutely, it would be a waste to leave her nameless.
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Why did you come to this place?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
I volunteered.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Even if you volunteered Are you nameless? It's not normal after all.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
I was asked to transfer because the regular army's special forces were short of
personnel.
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
I heard that the pay was better than the volunteer army, so I asked them about
it.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
I was told that the task given to me was somewhat tough.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Even the volunteer army is tough, so I thought it would be okay.
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
...When I came, it was completely different.
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
You've been fooled.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
If you're as good as you, I'm sure there are jobs out there that will pay you
more.
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
You'll definitely get a good price at my store...
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Please don't introduce that kind of work to your future children!
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
What are you talking about?
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Ahaha When you grow up A scholar-sensei will teach you.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
I won't tell you!
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Why so much in the first place?  Do you need money?
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
My father is a painter I want to support him until he gets his chance 
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
In this day and age, bread sells, paintings don't.
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
What kind of picture do you draw?  Oil painting?  Or watercolor?
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
All I do these days is drawing... I don't have any money.
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
But if you can buy good art supplies You can definitely draw something good. You
can win awards right away.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
If you could win an award for your art supplies, everyone would be a painter I
would call myself an artist.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
My father is a real artist!  If you have a chance  I'm sure...
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
Opportunities never come unless you take them.
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
If you need art supplies, work to buy them. I think people who have that kind of
passion are artists.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
I don't think he's a true artist if he uses his daughter's earnings to buy art
supplies and draw pictures...
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
But...I want to believe in my father.
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
I'm your only daughter.
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
Dad, how are you...?
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
Hey, Amy are you even writing a letter to your boyfriend?
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
No!  I'm writing to my father.
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Ah, my father is a self-proclaimed artist.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
I'm not calling myself that!
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
It's strange for someone like me to say that.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
To a useless adult  It's good to go out with you.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
That kind of adult  I've seen it like a mountain.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
You won't have to bear all your misfortune.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
That doesn't work!
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Is it wrong for a daughter to work hard for her father?
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
Not at all...  When it comes to my father  You're stubborn.
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Then why do you look so gloomy?
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
It has nothing to do with you!
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
Oh?  It's Julio-san's and  No.56's voice.
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
Absolutely... There are some bad adults here as well.
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
I wonder if they can't just take over the watch  quickly.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
I'm going
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
If you don't leave them alone, you'll only have a hard time if you get involved
with bad adults.
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
I can't leave you alone!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
Well, she's the type to fall for the wrong guy.
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
I've seen hundreds of girls like that... They'll never go away.
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Distributing mail!  Please accept it!
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
Yes, Gloria.  It's mail.
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
You can throw it away.  It's a bill or a demand letter anyway.
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Maybe there's good news ?  Yes, please!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
By the way Amy  I was writing a letter to your father.
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Have you received a reply?
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
...no
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Even though I write letters frequently.  He's a heartless father.
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
My father...is good at drawing, but he's not good at writing letters.
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
I see... it's normal for parents to write at least one letter for their
daughter.
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
I'm fine with it as long as my father draws a good picture.
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
Well then, I'll hand out the rest!
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
...She's a completely pathetic child.
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
Postal
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
...give it away
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
Yes, please
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
...phew
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
What, hurry up!
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
Oh, I'm sorry... No.56 was laughing, which is rare, so I just...
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
What the heck?
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
I wondered if my father would look like this when he saw my letter.
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
...huh
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
From your family?
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
My sister
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
I haven't seen you in a long time.
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
I might never see you again...
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
Don't make that face anymore... 
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
If you look sad, your happiness will disappear.
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
Huh?  What happened?
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
Right now...
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
No, nothing.
--------------------------------
[00000174][none]
I'm sure the others are also waiting for the letter. Hurry up!
--------------------------------
[00000175][none]
Oh, that's right!  I'm going!
--------------------------------
[00000176][none]
№15…… What is that?
--------------------------------
[00000177][none]
I... Can I stay here?
--------------------------------
[00000178][none]
If you continue to follow the regular army's instructions, you will definitely
lose your life.
--------------------------------
[00000179][none]
...Even though I ordered them to protect the trench, they ran away!
--------------------------------
[00000180][none]
I'm a human... I'm still alive!
--------------------------------
[00000181][none]
I'm fighting because there's someone I want to protect...
--------------------------------
[00000182][none]
Why do I have to die because of my ally!
--------------------------------
[00000183][none]
Is it because it's nameless?  Is it because he's a Dalxian?
--------------------------------
[00000184][none]
Damn it!  Why did this happen?
--------------------------------
[00000185][none]
I just want to protect Gaul... this country where my sister is!
--------------------------------
[00000186][none]
Even that isn't allowed...!
--------------------------------
[00000187][none]
As expected, the regular army's lookouts are full of holes.
--------------------------------
[00000188][none]
Now... I can run away!
--------------------------------
[00000189][none]
Ha, ha... If you've come this far...
--------------------------------
[00000190][none]
I did it... I escaped...!
--------------------------------
[00000191][none]
I'm free now!  Now I can go home...
--------------------------------
[00000192][none]
That's right, let's go home.
--------------------------------
[00000193][none]
Huh!?
--------------------------------
[00000194][none]
Mr. №56
--------------------------------
[00000195][none]
You... Why are you here!? Damn it, I'll make you die!
--------------------------------
[00000196][none]
Wait!
--------------------------------
[00000197][none]
Now you can still return without being noticed.  Let's go home
--------------------------------
[00000198][none]
...The guards couldn't have seen it. How did you notice?
--------------------------------
[00000199][none]
...It's close to home, isn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000200][none]
Why that!?
--------------------------------
[00000201][none]
The address of the sender of the letter... It was near here.
--------------------------------
[00000202][none]
That's why you noticed When I left
--------------------------------
[00000203][none]
yes
--------------------------------
[00000204][none]
But why did you follow me?  If you've come this far, you'll be treated as a
deserter too.
--------------------------------
[00000205][none]
Just leave you alone  Because I couldn't leave
--------------------------------
[00000206][none]
There is no reason!
--------------------------------
[00000207][none]
You look like my father...
--------------------------------
[00000208][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000209][none]
I feel like I want to try my best, but I don't get the recognition from those
around me.
--------------------------------
[00000210][none]
But I don't know what to do, so I'm worried and suffering...
--------------------------------
[00000211][none]
I told you that children wouldn't understand!  Okay, you can go back!
--------------------------------
[00000212][none]
I won't go back!
--------------------------------
[00000213][none]
I'm going to see my sister!  If I go back, I'll never have the chance to see you
again.
--------------------------------
[00000214][none]
That's enough... I'll take my sister and live quietly somewhere...
--------------------------------
[00000215][none]
But...
--------------------------------
[00000216][none]
...wait Can't you hear something?
--------------------------------
[00000217][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000218][none]
Is that... an Imperial Army reconnaissance vehicle...?
--------------------------------
[00000219][none]
Let's go back!  I have to let the captain know!
--------------------------------
[00000220][none]
no need
--------------------------------
[00000221][none]
What!?
--------------------------------
[00000222][none]
All members prepare to intercept Ambush the enemy reconnaissance unit.
--------------------------------
[00000223][none]
№56, №15, you guys too.
--------------------------------
[00000224][none]
Yes, yes!
--------------------------------
[00000225][none]
I...!
--------------------------------
[00000226][none]
Didn't you hear it?  Prepare for interception, hurry!
--------------------------------
[00000227][none]
Damn...I understand.
--------------------------------
[00000228][none]
End of battle Now, let's take care of one more problem.
--------------------------------
[00000229][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000230][none]
do whatever you like
--------------------------------
[00000231][none]
You two committed a serious violation of military discipline.
--------------------------------
[00000232][none]
Escape is punishable by firing squad, right?
--------------------------------
[00000233][none]
Of course but don't get me wrong.
--------------------------------
[00000234][none]
This guy is my hostage.  I brought you here because I thought you could use it!
--------------------------------
[00000235][none]
Ah...!
--------------------------------
[00000236][none]
Okay?  If you show any strange behavior I'll kill this guy!
--------------------------------
[00000237][none]
No, I am!
--------------------------------
[00000238][none]
Shut up!
--------------------------------
[00000239][none]
№56, did you try to go back to your house?
--------------------------------
[00000240][none]
Yes!  I'll meet my sister again!  And the two of us...
--------------------------------
[00000241][none]
Unfortunately, that wish won't come true.
--------------------------------
[00000242][none]
Teme!  Is it okay if this guy's head gets blown off?
--------------------------------
[00000243][none]
Can your gun fire without disengaging the safety?
--------------------------------
[00000244][none]
Huh!?
--------------------------------
[00000245][none]
And don't get me wrong. It's not your fault that you can't see your sister. 
--------------------------------
[00000246][none]
What!?
--------------------------------
[00000247][none]
№56 Your sister is dead
--------------------------------
[00000248][none]
What...!?
--------------------------------
[00000249][none]
Is that so!?
--------------------------------
[00000250][none]
Today, you, my only immediate family member, received a document asking you to
process your sister's death.
--------------------------------
[00000251][none]
Apparently he was too late to escape and got caught up in the battle.
--------------------------------
[00000252][none]
That's a lie...!  It's definitely a lie!!
--------------------------------
[00000253][none]

……
--------------------------------
[00000257][none]
...we went on a night reconnaissance and discovered an enemy scouting force and
destroyed it.
--------------------------------
[00000258][none]
The discoverers were No. 56 and No. 15 Thank you for your hard work.
--------------------------------
[00000259][none]
Captain...

Return promptly That's all.
--------------------------------
[00000261][none]
Ugh... ugh!  Uoooooooooooooo!

Daito has awakened
@fcFF008800 ``remembrance of his sister'' @fci instead of 
@fcFF008800 ``hating people'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000263][none]
Amy has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 ``remembrance of her father'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000264][none]
Sigh... That was a terrible battle. The desert is already full.
--------------------------------
[00000265][none]
I told you, right?  The desert is hell.
--------------------------------
[00000266][none]
...get out of the way
--------------------------------
[00000267][none]
Ugh... Did you see your face just now?
--------------------------------
[00000268][none]
No.56 has changed I thought he was a bad guy 
--------------------------------
[00000269][none]
That person's heart was eaten by a dead person... It's bad in a different sense.
--------------------------------
[00000270][none]
What does it mean?
--------------------------------
[00000271][none]
I want to die, and even more, I want to kill.
--------------------------------
[00000272][none]
A soldier fascinated by death...
--------------------------------
[00000273][none]
Shit... why am I still alive...
--------------------------------
[00000274][none]
You're covered in scars!  Get your allowance quickly!
--------------------------------
[00000275][none]
Don't bring any medicine... Where's the bullet?  Where is the enemy?
--------------------------------
[00000276][none]
Stay strong!
--------------------------------
[00000277][none]
I heard where is the person who killed my sister?
--------------------------------
[00000278][none]
……!!
--------------------------------
[00000279][none]
I'll kill as many Imperial bastards as possible and die!  That's it for me!!
--------------------------------
[00000280][none]
That's no good!  Please take care of yourself!
--------------------------------
[00000281][none]
It doesn't matter anymore!  I decided to fight to protect my sister!
--------------------------------
[00000282][none]
And yet... why is my sister dead and me still alive?
--------------------------------
[00000283][none]
That's strange That's...!
--------------------------------
[00000284][none]
I'm trash!  It's the scum of scum!
--------------------------------
[00000285][none]
You're not trash You're a kind person.
--------------------------------
[00000286][none]
If he's really no good, he won't take me hostage and protect me from desertion
charges.
--------------------------------
[00000287][none]
You're a kind person... You shouldn't die in a war like this.
--------------------------------
[00000288][none]
There's no one left to cry when I die.
--------------------------------
[00000289][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000290][none]
Because I cry
--------------------------------
[00000291][none]

--------------------------------
[00000293][none]
You...

[00000294][none]
Ugh...
--------------------------------
[00000295][none]

[00000296][none]
...say that again
--------------------------------
[00000297][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000298][none]
...That's just like my sister's accent. Both her voice and the way she says it.
--------------------------------
[00000299][none]
Yes...
--------------------------------
[00000300][none]

[00000307][none]

--------------------------------
[00000308][none]
