[00000002][none]
Hey everyone!  I have good news!
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
It seems that the story of us being thrown into the fierce battleground has been
postponed!
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
Good news.  Unusual
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
That commander seems to be an idiot who doesn't know any strategies other than
assault.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
No matter how many lives you have it's not enough.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
I feel sorry for the regular army guys too.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
What's wrong, Serge Why are you making that face?
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
Are you feeling unwell from eating too much food?
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
It's not Alphonse or you. That can't be true.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
So what?
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
...I wanted to fight
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Maybe you are aiming for a punitive pardon ?
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Do you want to be active and transfer to a better unit ?
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
No, it's not.
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
I asked Commander Crow to transfer me to this unit.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
There is no amnesty.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Even if you requested a transfer...  There's a limit to how much you like
things.
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Serge was transferred from the regular army, right?  Why did you choose this
place?
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
This unit suits me the most 
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
You're the only one who would say that...
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
That's a little unusual.
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
It's true that they were a terrible unit until a while ago.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Kurt is here now, right?
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Is he that good?
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Yes!  Kurt-san is the ideal soldier.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
Always calm, quick to make decisions, without hesitation...
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
I think he's the ideal commander for the soldiers. I'm happy to be able to fight
under him.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Even if you're a soldier, aren't you a support soldier?
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
It doesn't matter!
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
As someone who stands on the battlefield, the command is...goho!  Goho, goho!
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Don't get so excited Serge
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
Sorry...
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
I wonder if Kurt is that good...
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
This is the battle line we're heading towards.
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Faced with a large Imperial force, the friendly forces officially decided to
abandon their base and retreat.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Goho, goho!  Ugh... Excuse me, Goho.
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
It's noisy
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
...I'm sorry. Please continue, Captain.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
Don't worry. If you're not feeling well, you can rest in the first aid tent.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
It's okay!  Please let me be here Please!
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
This isn't a briefing that forces you to do it. Why don't you take a break?
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
No!  I can't rest!
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
You're desperate...
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
Kurt and Serge are kind of similar. They're always serious.
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Quiet!  Continue talking
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
We plan to provide support for the withdrawal of friendly forces 
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
However, it is unlikely that the Imperial Army will pursue the area where you
are heading for support.
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Good!  That's very welcome.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
I'm really glad that things have changed 
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
...Can't we fight again?
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
You really wanted to fight. Why?
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Yeah, I don't see it as belligerent, though.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
That's terrible... I feel like my arm is falling off like this.
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
Serge?  You're a support soldier, so why are you doing target practice?
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
...it's a whim
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
On a whim... You almost hit the mark. Are you really a support soldier?
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
That's right.
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
If you have that much skill, why...
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
I don't care about the military class.
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
I am now...
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
I have to be grateful for just standing on the battlefield.
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
What do you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Sorry to bother you Please come here.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
Serge...
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
We have received reports that a large Imperial force is pursuing friendly
forces.
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Shouldn't it have come this far?
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Pursuing the Imperial Army has no strategic significance.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
I think they gained more momentum by achieving more than expected results.
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Do you mean just leave it like this ?
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Friendly forces have been chased unexpectedly and are on the run.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
We must support our friendly forces.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
This is the worst development...
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
This is how it ends up...
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
So, what should we do?
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
Stay at the tail end of friendly forces cut off pursuit by imperial forces
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
You want us to be wiped out!  I'm not kidding!
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
It's impossible to stop it with just one platoon...
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
I can't do it...
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Captain, I'll do it.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Serge?
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
All you have to do is stop the enemy, right?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Then I alone is enough 
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
What are you talking about?  There's no way you can!
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Do you have any ideas?
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
When I was in the regular army, I was a sniper If I could use the terrain...
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
I'll do everything by myself to stop the enemy troops.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Serge, you...!  Don't say anything stupid!
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
Sniper... I guess that's the reason why his shooting skills are so high 
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
Please let me do it, Captain.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
...rejected Too little certainty
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
!!
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
And your death will not bring any benefit to the unit Dismiss.
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
Of course.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Plan your strategy as soon as possible Wait until you receive instructions.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
...I understand
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
But I...
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
Captain, I'm sorry Just once I'll disobey you.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Captain!  Serge went out alone !
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
That guy...!  Kurt!  I'll go help!
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Do not act alone Change your planned strategy Move forward with your unit.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Is it okay!?
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Even if I abandon Serge, the situation will not improve And...
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
I won't forgive Serge ...Let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Are you still... alive? I disobeyed the captain's orders I was going to die...
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Hahaha...gohogohoho
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
It's painful...I see. I'm still alive...
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
Serge!
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
Captain...
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
As a soldier, I am useful...
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
Huh!? Captain...?
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Don't waste your life
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
No!  I...!
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Your life is too precious for us to lose.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
Damn... Me too That's not even me...!
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
I don't want to lose either!  But...!
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
My life is about to end...!
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
Gohogoho!
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
It's an incurable disease. By the time I discovered it, it was too late...
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Because of that, I was expelled from the regular army.
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
But I wanted to fight so... I asked Nameless to join me.
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
I've always been looking for a place to die.
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
This battle is worthy... Because I thought so, I disobeyed my captain.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
I had decided that if I was going to die, I would die on the battlefield,
fulfilling my mission as a soldier.
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Lying in bed, getting weaker day by day...
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
I don't want to be swallowed up by death!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
...I'm scared
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
... Is that all you want to say?
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Eh...
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
Violation of orders will result in death by firing , but I will not allow you to
die with such complacency. 
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
Punishment worse than firing As long as you live Work for this unit.
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
However, the next time you violate the order, you will be sent to the hospital
immediately.
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
I'll make sure you won't be able to leave the hospital again Be prepared.
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Captain...!
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
One last command Don't die until I say it's okay to die...That's it.
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Captain...Ugh Captain, Ugh...Ah
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
The reply is
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Yes...!!
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Thank you If I were under you... I could live again.
--------------------------------
