Ilmari has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 "Melody of Passion" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
@fcFFFFF5F0@dc9F555555@db2@dt1@lt1Seiryoku 1935, near Antholt
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Looks like the next mission is going to be terrible.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
The role is to become a decoy for the regular army and be chased by the imperial
army.
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
What will happen if the Imperial Army catches up with us...
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
The captain said that it would be better if we weren't caught up ?
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Aren't you afraid of dying That guy...
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
It's not like I'm going to die, so let's take it easy...
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
How can you say that?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
If things look like they're going to get dangerous, just run away.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
I refuse to die for my country.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
If you desert, you will be shot...
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
Besides, there's no way you can run away whenever you want.
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
It'll work out If you do it properly
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
Why did that random person come to Nameless?
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
I found myself here I don't know why.
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
There must be a reason I was arrested and came here.
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Which unit were you in before?  You understand that much , right?
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
I don't know about any troops. I was always at home.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Home is you...
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Refuse to be drafted...
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Were you doing anything at home?
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
So there's nothing
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
I was just playing music as a hobby 
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
Instrument?
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
No, I quit right away It was a hassle.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Ah, I hope you get out of here quickly and live a leisurely life...
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
You're old and you're such a bastard... You're like an old aristocrat.
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
But, when I look at you, I feel a strange sense of kinship.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
Is there some hidden passion smoldering?  That kind of thing
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
By the way, do you like delicious food?
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Well, I don't dislike it.
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
In that case, why don't you serve my special dish next time?
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Yeah, but Don't take a nap You'll never wake up.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
This guy is big ...in a bad way.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
Guuu...guu ...guuu
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Ilmari!  Hey, wake up!  It's my home cooking!
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Hmm...?
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Even though it's called cooking it's just sweets.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Come on, eat!
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
I told you not to take a nap...
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
Don't sleep!  The best fire-baked muffins were made!
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
You can do it later... Even if you eat it now, you won't be able to taste it...
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
What's the point? I was able to create something I'm proud of.
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Wow!  Looks delicious!  Can I have it?
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
Oh?
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Is this Julio's handmade?  That's amazing!
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
R-Riera-chan...!?
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Hmm... it's delicious!! Wow!  So sweet!
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Haha, it seems to suit your taste I'm glad...
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
When it's freshly baked, the aroma and fluffiness are completely different!
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Can I have another one?  I'll give it to Kurt!
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Riera-chan highly praised it?
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Ilmari...?  During your nap You'll never wake up...
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
Oooh... I'm so jealous!  It's frustrating...!
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Wait, there are some mysterious impressions mixed in?
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
It's outrageous!  With food like this Please make Riera-chan happy!
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Yeah!? Did you really fall in love with that Grim Reaper?
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Then what?  Are you complaining?
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
I have nothing to complain about... Aren't you scared?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
What's scary about such a cute girl?
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
I-I see... Just to be sure, what do you like about her?
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
Where, ho, ho...
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Your cheeks look so soft!
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Huh!?
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Damn it!  I'll make Riera-chan happy too!
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
Where are you going, hey!  However, her cheeks seem  soft...
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Haa, haa, haa...
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Oh, you're back?
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Is that a trumpet?  Now that I think about it, you were playing music.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
Let me listen to one song.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
What about Riela-chan!?
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Isn't it still Kurt's place?
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
What... Stop it, stop it!
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
sleep
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Is this what you call single-mindedness...?  Hmm, I don't know...
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
The operation will start soon...
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
If you're not good at it, you'll never be able to cook again. You have to put in
the effort.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Enemy attack!  Get ready for battle now!
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
Wait a minute!? Even though it's a decoy operation, Why did the enemy appear
before I could move!?
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
The enemy's warning range is wider than expected It seems they have detected us.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
What!?
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
As soon as I set my sights on you, the decoy operation was a success.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
The bite is too fast The regular army's attack can not be done in time.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
It will stop the enemy troops for a while.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Huh?  Hey Kurt Don't you know Ilmari?
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
I haven't seen you here yet.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Where did you go? At a time like this!  I'll go find it!
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
You were in a place like this!  I looked for it!
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Wait a minute, I think I'm about to remember the old feeling.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
What, are you practicing the trumpet...?
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Yes
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
That's right... The enemy is already here!  Maybe if you practice casually!
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
So wait!!
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Ilmari...?
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
Tsk! It's still no good!  Because it's blank No good at all!!
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
I've remembered how to make the sound, but I don't like the tone!
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
I can't play it exactly the way I want...!
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
Ilmari... You can make such a desperate face 
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
I don't care about your face It's the sound, the sound!  The sound is bad!
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
I guess you had the passion after all.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Has your passion for music returned because of what happened the other day?
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
Passion?  What do you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
No?
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
I don't care about the music.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
It depends on whether Riela-chan is happy or not!  This is no good at all!
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
I see, that's what it means.
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Enough... The trumpet is no good after all. 
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
I don't care anymore I can go on the battlefield or whatever I can just go, just
go.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
He's incredibly horny. He's the type often found among geniuses, but...
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Shit, there's nothing!  Something that will make Riera-chan happy...!
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
The enemy is retreating!  What do you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
I don't care what the reason is If the enemy is going home Let's go home too.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
No, the decoy was discovered. Instead of retreating, they went to attack the
regular army.
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
But with that number, even the regular army would be fine.
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
Captain!  A company of the Imperial Army is joining us as reinforcements!
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
Reinforcements!? If they join us, the regular army will be outnumbered!
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
I don't really care. You know the regular army was attacked. It's like that.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
If we don't at least prevent them from merging, we'll be acting as a decoy...
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Don't do that...
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
I'm going!
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
I'll act as a decoy and keep the reinforcements away!
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Riela-chan...!?
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
Riera, solo action is not allowed If you're going to do it, go with the whole
platoon.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
Just to get attention One person is enough I can go.
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Rejected
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
Yes, rejected!
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Hey, Ilmari!?
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
I can't let Riera-chan go. It's my turn here.
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
What do you mean?  I refuse to act as a decoy for you in my place.
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
No, I'll take the bait!  This is decided!
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Violating orders means being shot!?
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Shoot me... In that case, use my life in a meaningful way.
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
I'm asking you if you want to kill me here and waste it Order a decoy and make
it useful 
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
I'm serious, I'm sorry to die for my country 
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
I'll die for what I love!
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Don't joke at times like this
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
No kidding!  Let's go!  Oraaaaaaaaaa!!
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
Ilmari!
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Ilmari!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
Wait, Kurt!  Ilmari is serious Will you let me go?
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
That's his personality He never does anything he can't do.
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
I'm sure they had a plan and volunteered to act as a decoy. Trust me, I'll do
it!
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Julio...
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
Okay, here it is!  It's fine here!
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
The wind is right, the direction is right!
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Deliver it!!
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
He... He hasn't come back yet Are you okay...
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
I want to believe that you're safe, but...
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
Hey, it's over.
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
Ilmari!  Were you okay?
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
Report results to Ilmari
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
The Gallic army's marching trumpet has been blown. That's all.
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
That's it!?
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
My trumpet can reach further than a gun from upwind.
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
When I fired one shot, the enemy was surprised by the invisible Gallic army and
panicked.
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
I see, it's a trumpet.
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
His skill was real.
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
Hehehe...
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
Thank you, Ilmari
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
Riela-chan... Just seeing that smile makes me happy!
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
But... Doesn't Riera-chan like Kurt ?
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
Don't cry even if you don't look back at me, okay?
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
Don't make fun of me!  I don't want that 
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
As long as I see her smile, I'm satisfied!
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
Is that so!?
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
Look at those soft cheeks!  Oh, Riera-chan...
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
I don't understand... Are you a genius after all, or are you just a weirdo...?
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
I wish I could use that seriousness for other things.
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
That's wonderful Riera-chan...
--------------------------------
