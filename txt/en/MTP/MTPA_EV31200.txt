--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
The next mission is to defend the supply area.
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Ehehe, for our mission, that's pretty decent.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
It's not something to be happy about.
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
This supply area is a hotly contested area where there is an ongoing battle with
the Imperial Army.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
The regular army didn't want to protect us We were chosen... That's probably
what happened.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Don't say that Let's do our best.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Look, like that person.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Hmm...?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
…………
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
Ah, №58?
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
If I remember correctly, it was Shin-san. He kept silently carrying the luggage.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
I guess he's quiet.
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Shin!  Would you like to take a break?
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
consideration, pain
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
But I haven't finished my assigned role yet.
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Please don't talk to me so I can concentrate on my work.
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
I-I'm sorry...
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Oh, what a waste to turn down Amy's invitation 
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
He missed out on Nameless's greatest moment of relaxation.
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
No, it's fine. I called out to you when I was trying my hardest. 
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
I appreciate that he's a hard worker, but he doesn't have a sense of humor.
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
It might be fun to educate and change things like that.
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
That must be tough.
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
That's okay It's burning... Ufufu!
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
...It's over.
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Thank you for your hard work!  Would you like some tea?
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
I can't stand it. But I'll be on sentry soon. I want to refrain from drinking
water.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
I see...
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Wait. It's polite to have at least one drink over there, right?
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Which is more important: courtesy or duty?  I don't need to answer.
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
Okay, excuse me.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Well, this guy has another reaction that even I couldn't predict...
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Maybe it's your country's culture.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
What is your country?
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Shin-san, it seems you've been living in your mother's home country for a long
time.
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Where is your home country?
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
It was said to be an island nation far east of the continent. It was said to be
beyond the Empire.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Farther than that big empire?
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
I guess the culture is different too.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
I was appointed as a sentry. My name is Shin Huga. Please take care of me.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
I'm Serge Liebert. Nice to meet you.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Um, Shin-san.
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
Enemy?
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
No, sentries concentrate on guard.
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
If you concentrate too much, you'll lose concentration in the second half,
right?
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
Don't worry. If ordered, I'll stay focused all day and night.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
That's amazing
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Anyone who has studied Zen can do it.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
What is ``Zen'' the country where Mr. Shin lived ?
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
It is something that trains the mind It is also the practice of a warrior.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
There is a mysterious culture 
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
...For me, it's strange how the people in this unit think.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Even though I am a soldier fighting for my country and my master.
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Being polite to your friends is more important than the role given to you by
your master... I don't understand it.
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Does everyone in Shin-san's country think that way?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
At least soldiers risk their lives for their masters.
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
I have been taught that if the Lord commands death, one should humbly sacrifice
one's life.
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
That's... amazing
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
It seems that my culture and way of thinking cannot be understood in this
country.
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
That's why it's difficult Hmm...
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
I'll be working with you a lot.
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Hmm
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
...you don't talk to me much.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
I feel at ease thanks to you.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
I'm not a talker either.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
I see
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
...Also, from you I sense the desperate determination that a warrior should
have.
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
It calms me 
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Your will to protect your homeland... The warrior's mindset will tell you 
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
It's okay for me to be here.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Mr. Shin...
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Why are you Nameless?
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
It was January when my mother passed away and I went to Gaul, my father's
homeland, with my father.
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
The war soon started I volunteered for the volunteer army.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
Then, because of his foreign blood, he was ordered to be transferred. He was
registered here.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
I see... It must be hard to be in Gaul.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
no
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
Eh...
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
Gaul... This country recognized me as a citizen.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Therefore, I would like to repay the kindness of Princess Cordelia, the lord of
the country.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
My life, my loyalty is to be dedicated to Princess Cordelia.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
I have never felt any pain.
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
I'm clumsy I might not be able to get used to Gaul from now on.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
But I will still live and die for my master.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
I can't change this idea because I don't know any other way to live 
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
...I don't think there's any need to forcefully change it 
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
However, it might be a good idea to take a little more look around.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Around...?
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
This squad was also disjointed at first.
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
Everyone does whatever they want only what they want ...
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
I thought it might not work as it is 
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
After Kurt became the captain, my mindset gradually changed 
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
I learned to think not only about myself, but also about the troops.
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
With the members united, the unit has definitely started moving in a positive
direction 
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
Shin-san, if you look around, you might discover something new .
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
... I'm sorry for saying something so arrogant 
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
No... It was an idea I didn't have.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Hmm Let's think about it for a moment.
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
From now on, Nameless will be responsible for the defense of this supply base.
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
This supply area is a key strategic location for both armies.
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Stay alert so that you can respond to attacks at any time.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Your will!
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Of course
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
...this silence I feel the enemy's eyes on me
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
That's right... I too find this silence dangerous.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
But no matter what enemy comes, we will definitely defend it to the death.
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
Even if it means sacrificing your life!
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
Your enthusiasm is good, but don't be so careless as to trade it for your life.
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
I have no intention of sacrificing my team members to accomplish my mission.
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
Captain?
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
Since I joined this unit 
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Don't think about dying Think about living and contributing to the squad First.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Huh... I'm from a foreign country after all It seems like there's a difference
in my thinking.
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
What do you mean...?
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
I have given up attachment to life when I serve the Lord.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Because I believe that's what a samurai should be.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
Do you consider death to be precious?
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
A person who is not afraid of death That is a warrior.
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Mr. Shin...
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
A foreign warrior...
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
It's tough, Captain!
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
What's wrong?
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
A large Imperial army is heading towards this supply area!
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
Are you here? Everyone, prepare for battle!  Hurry!
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
It will be a deadly battle
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
But I will fulfill the life entrusted to me no matter what!
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Shin has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 "loyalty" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
The second wave of enemies is coming!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
It's impossible to continue fighting We'll temporarily withdraw!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Understood!
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Mr. Shin!  It's going down!
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
...No!
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
What are you doing!  Retreat is an order!
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
The orders I received from my master were to protect this land!  I don't regret
my life!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
That idiot... He pushed in the other direction and ended up going...!
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Captain!! I will support him!  Give me permission!
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
You'll just die too I can't allow it.
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
But!  If this continues, Mr. Shin will do it!
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
Alphonse What's the situation?
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Okay, let's go!
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Alright, assault troops and tanks form a formation and move forward!
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
forward? What do you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
From now on, we will support the volunteer army company!
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
Huh!?
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
I have requested reinforcements on the emergency line.
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
There was a unit that responded!  Good...
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
Please don't scare me I thought you were abandoning Shin-san... 
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
Moving forward!  Fold all at once!
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
Confirmed the withdrawal of enemy troops. Thanks to the reinforcements, We were
able to defend the supply area.
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
Even the stubborn person saved his life, so all is well.
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
Why didn't you withdraw?  Let's hear the reason
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
I prioritized the mission I received from my master.
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
What does that mean?
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
To protect this land is to protect the territory of my lord, Princess
Cordelia...
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
In other words, he risked his life for Gaul's lord and land.
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
So you ignored my orders for Gaul's sake?
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
Loyalty to the lord is absolute No one can compromise this 
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
This guy is stupid...
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
That's hardcore...
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
Well, it should be nameless sending...
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
If you're going to punish me, I'll just accept it.
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
Stay loyal to your master without regrets
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
Please wait, Mr. Shin.
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
If you are loyal to your master, you must obey your captain's orders.
--------------------------------
[00000174][none]
Why?
--------------------------------
[00000175][none]
The captain commands the squad on behalf of the monarch. Is that correct?
--------------------------------
[00000176][none]
Hmm!!
--------------------------------
[00000177][none]
Serge-dono is right.
--------------------------------
[00000178][none]
I tried to repay my kindness to the princess, but I got caught up in a great
mission.
--------------------------------
[00000179][none]
I forgot to serve as a member of the team in order to accomplish the mission...
I was unaware!
--------------------------------
[00000180][none]
Well then, let's cut our teeth and atone for violating the order. Is that okay?
--------------------------------
[00000181][none]
Wait!  What if I cut my stomach off!?
--------------------------------
[00000182][none]
I know the etiquette!
--------------------------------
[00000183][none]
Oh no!! Someone stop it!
--------------------------------
[00000184][none]
Kurt!! Do something!
--------------------------------
[00000185][none]
Shin, that action disturbs the discipline of the group Stop it now.
--------------------------------
[00000186][none]
Hmm...if it's a command, absolutely not.
--------------------------------
[00000187][none]
From now on, you will respect the laws of Gaul and military discipline.
--------------------------------
[00000188][none]
I have to prove my loyalty to Princess Cordelia Okay?
--------------------------------
[00000189][none]
Your will!
--------------------------------
