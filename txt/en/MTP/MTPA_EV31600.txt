[00000001][none]
This mission I feel blue I can't help but sigh.
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
The remnants of the Imperial Army are holed up in the village we are heading to
now.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
It's Nameless's job to do something about this.
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
Well... I don't care about imperial soldiers.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
The reason I'm blue is because I don't have many good memories of the village
I'm going to.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Putting the mission aside Let's talk about myself.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
The reason I was sent to Nameless 
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
In a nutshell, that's the secret of an unpopular man.
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
I've been friends with most girls since I was a child.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
But most boys hated me.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
So this is what happens when the superior who has the right to personnel affairs
is a man.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
As rumored, Nameless was the worst place, but there is salvation in any place.
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
There are girls here too I love getting to know them 
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
If it's a girl, I'll woo her and show her that she's a ``shinigami.''
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Let's get along!  Oh, I have to go to Kurt!
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Yeah, sometimes there are people I can't help with.
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
I don't think she even remembers that I wooed her.
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
As expected, the Grim Reaper was tough.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
none
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Her only complaint was 
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
It was the shortest time in my life.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
I don't think this record will ever be broken.
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
All men in the world are equal
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
It's shameful to give special treatment to just one person.
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
It didn't matter.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Even if he is the richest man in the world, to her he is just a servant.
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Do you want to date?  Will you accompany me every day for morning practice
before sunrise ?
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
You don't have to force yourself.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
I guess what she and I see are too different.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
History means to know about humans The origin of humanity...
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
I don't know why The history lecture has started 
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
I feel bad for her, but I had no choice but to escape along the way.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
I only date people who are richer than me.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Did you even try to woo Gloria?
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
Grandma, you look very cute in some ways.
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
In the end, Amy is the only one who hasn't wooed In other words, the success
rate is zero.
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
But I want you to remember that this is a special unit called Nameless.
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
The girls here are just not normal.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Hello Mr. Elliott
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
Hey, what's up, little guy?
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
Please stop saying that!
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
I'm sorry I can't because you're so cute 
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Are you angry?
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
That face doesn't suit you.
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
Everyone is telling to stay away from Elliott.
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
It's hard being a popular guy Everyone feels bad that Amy and I get along 
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Mr. Elliot is a marriage fraudster so don't be fooled.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
Hehe... Ahahaha!
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
What's wrong?
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
I can't propose to Amy yet.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Don't treat me like a child!
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
I'll come and pick you up in five more years.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Why would you commit marriage fraud?
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Fraud is a misunderstanding
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Is that so!?
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
However, it is true that I was sent to Nameless for marriage fraud.
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
You're a liar after all!
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
No, I'm just in a serious relationship.
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
However, when it comes to marriage, I feel like running away. I get scared.
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
I don't really understand that.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
It's a complicated issue  But I can't stop wooing women 
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Didn't anyone seriously think about getting married?
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Hmm, I forgot.
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Really?
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
really true
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
The remnants of the imperial army are still holed up in the village.
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
A young woman is held hostage and cannot be touched.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Taking a girl hostage is the worst.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
Two days have passed since the barricade began The hostages' physical strength
is at its limit.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
We must rescue the hostages as soon as possible.
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
But if the rescue fails, we will be responsible for it.
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
The anger of the people will be directed at us.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Can't we negotiate hostage ?
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
We have been ordered not to engage in hostage negotiations.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
If you wait a few more days the hostages will die and you can take control
without hesitation.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
The command seems to think that the people's feelings will also turn towards
hatred towards the Empire.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Are you saying that it's better to let them die?
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
I can understand the intention from the mission instructions.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
Is there anything I can do?
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
I'd like to do something, but there's nothing I can do as long as there are
hostages.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
As long as I rush in and rescue the hostages, there's no problem, right?
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
That's right, but it's unusual for you to volunteer.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
The enemy of women is my enemy.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
...If that's the reason, I can't give you permission to enter.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Haha, just kidding Actually, I have some connections with this village 
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
I have the building's location and interior layout in mind.
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
What do you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
That's right... Is it okay to call it a place of memories ?
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Anyway Of all the members, I am certainly the most knowledgeable about this
village.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Kurt-kun Will you leave it to me?
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
Are you confident that you can do it?
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
I'm a doer when it's time for me to do it.I'll prove it to you.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
...Okay I'll leave it to you, Elliot.
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
Elliot rushes in Other members back up Elliot with all their might 
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
The hostage rescue operation has begun!
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
Elliot has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 "Pale Memories" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
I told you I'm the guy who does it when it's time to do it.
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Thank you everyone !
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
Elliott's credit It was cool.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Why? Helping women is the purpose of life for me.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
Thanks to you I was saved Thank you!
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
I'm so honored to be like you...
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
Ah...
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]

--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
Well, you're so beautiful that I lost my voice.
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
You're good at it.
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
...I'm glad you're safe.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Mom!
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Okay, okay It's okay now.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
Your child...?  Good for you, little girl Mom is back.
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Yes!  Thank you uncle!
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Um, at least tell me your name...
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
I'm not worth mentioning 
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
Why didn't you try to woo that person?
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
That's terrible, Amy.
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
Did you really think I was the kind of guy who would seduce a mother in front of
her children?
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
No?
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Ahaha I see.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
She forgot my face though
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
I seriously tried to seduce you once.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
Are you serious Maybe...
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
That's the thing Amy is smart.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
...I'm sorry
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
There's no need to apologize
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
I'm glad she looks happy
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
I always put a girl's happiness first Isn't it true?
--------------------------------
