--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
...I never thought I'd wear this military uniform again.
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Isn't it good? It's like a class reunion, right?
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
These clothes are filled with all kinds of memories.
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
It was a tough day, but now I feel nostalgic about everything!
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
I thought I wouldn't be able to wear this dress anymore, but it still fit me
perfectly...
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Okay, okay Amy is cute so it's okay.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Captain and Riera-san are really getting married, aren't they?
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Don't you believe it?  We all thought we'd end up together.
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
That's right!  I thought that was definitely the case.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
There must have been a lot of kids who were targeting Kurt?
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
Yes, Captain Kurt... He was shining.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
What you say is problematic!
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
I was surprised when I received the invitation.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
It was hard for even me to find everyone's addresses, wasn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Even though they all fled outside of Gaul, I did a thorough investigation.
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Hehe, you have no choice but to do what the captain orders you to do, right?
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Today's dish I'm the chef Look forward to it!
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
The chef continues.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
I miss the Julio food I ate on the battlefield. It was delicious!
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
You... Have you gained weight again?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Well, let's just use Alphonse as nostalgic military rations.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
I maintained that body shape even on a military diet. I can't lose weight just
like that, can I?
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
It's been a long time Thank you very much for that time 
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
Were you able to meet him again?
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
Yes, I'm at home today taking care of the children 
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Children...?  That means...
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Yes, a child was born before today's bride and groom... 
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
That's right!  Congratulations on that!
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
It's a great love. I want to have a love like that, too.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
...It feels good It feels good to have friends who are like family to have a
family...
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Hehe, Felix-san, why don't you think about having a family that's more than just
friends?
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
I'm sure he'll be a good father!
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
You look happy, Clarissa.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Yes Children are really cute.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
Should I educate my husband so he doesn't cheat?
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Hehe... It's okay Educating a husband is a wife's job, right?
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Oh my, This looks tough.
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Alphonse!  Where is my foil walking around?!
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
After all, it doesn't feel right without me?
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
Whip gets bored without you!
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
Oh!  I feel like crying with nostalgia
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
Are you still working hard to educate useless men?
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
Well, there are bad men in every country, so I won't be bored.
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
If it's a small country, maybe an absolute queen system can be realized ?
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
I don't need a small country!  Aim for the continent!ã€€World!
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Well then, without giving up, I'll aim from the Gallic Falcon to the Gallic
Phoenix.
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
What are you saying with a stomach that looks like a roasted bird?  Education!
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Buha!?
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Same as always...
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
Ah, that's a familiar sight.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Ah, Riera-chan... This day has finally come. 
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
You're so effeminate, Ilmari. Kurt-kun is a good man. Let's celebrate.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
I sincerely congratulate Riera-chan on starting a new life.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
I admit that Kurt is a good man...I'm number two though.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
I often say it with that face. After Kurt, I'm next. Anyone who asks me will say
that.
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Well, let's let them decide which one is better.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Good!  Maybe We might have a new encounter.
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Hi Gisele You look beautiful today too.
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Beyond that, Kurt-san is cold, isn't he?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
Did something happen with Kurt?
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
Even though I had prepared the performance, it was no good...
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
Gisele-chan's performance Maybe...
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
A miraculous escape show where the bride and groom jump out of the burning
ceremony hall...
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
I don't need a miracle!  Let's celebrate normally, normally.
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
So, is it for me?  Would you like to escape in place of the bride and groom?
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
No, it's nothing!  Ahaha
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
Will I gain anything by dating you guys?
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
That's perfect, dude.
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Rather, both of you Please pay the membership fee. I'm the secretary.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Haha, it's still neat...
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
By the way, would you two like to buy one tank each?  You can get about 30% off.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
Maybe drive in a tank.
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
There are one or two people you don't like, right?
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Shoot!
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Wait, wait We're not in that era anymore.
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Hehe... A stingy man is not popular.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Fail.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
As expected from Margit-chan That's the expected reaction.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Apparently he's still a soldier 
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
In order to obtain nationality, have your relatives living in a foreign country
adopt you.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
It's a small country, but I've been promoted to captain now.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
Isn't it amazing? I often joined the army in a foreign country.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
You bought me experience Because the war on the continent is still not over 
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
Come to think of it, So you're adopted. What's your name?
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
My current name is Margit Helms.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
...Actually, I wanted to be Margit Irving.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Huh?  Did you have feelings for Kurt?
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Admiration, just
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
I understand that feeling just a little bit. Let's drink today.
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Yes, I'd like a drink that gets you drunk.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
I saw you. What have you been doing?
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Hello, Frederica
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
As always Men are really stupid and cute.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
Are you still working to bring in men?
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
It's worth living That's right, womanizers Would you like to help me with my
work?
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
No matter how many lives you have it seems like it's not enough.
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
Okay, I'll refrain from saying that.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
What, that's fine!
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
It was an incredible troop after all. Nameless is
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Ah, this woman is a heavy burden for us...
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
I was so excited today that I arrived at the venue before sunrise!
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
You still wake up early. Are you still training ?
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
I still haven't reached my true strength!  Next month I'm going to stay in the
mountains!
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
That single-minded passion... It's dazzling.
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
Mr. Gloria Are you still alive?
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
That's my line even though I said I was about to give up 
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
I felt a little greedy. I decided to live until this day. 
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Don't say that Let's challenge ourselves to see how far we can go!
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Yes, I'll try to live my life with no regrets, just like Kurt!
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
I don't think Cedric will come.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
As expected of Alphonse, he was grumbling that he couldn't find his whereabouts.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
Who can't come?
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Cedric!? Why are you here?
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
If I'm missing, we won't have everyone.
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
I won't let you escape... I'll arrest you this time!
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
What are the charges?  Since I'm treated as dead, all my sins in Gaul are
erased, right?
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
Besides, does Ada have the right to arrest ?
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
You don't have to be a police officer to catch a criminal red-handed.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
So, as long as we don't do anything, there's no problem with us being together,
right?
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Keep an eye on me, Cedric Don't think you can escape.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Today is an auspicious day for those who have taken care of us Let's greet them
with a smile.
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
...Of course but I won't let you escape absolutely...!
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
Well, if you want to be with me that much, why don't you make me your wife?
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Who would be the worst wife in history?
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
Zahar-dono, your cup is empty Let me offer you a drink.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
Let's have it. The doctor said that if I drink it again, I'll die!
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Oh my god!  I didn't know that. Sorry!
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
Don't worry about it!  That's an auspicious seat!
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
You're so happy that you can't take care of yourself... You have to apologize
with all your heart!
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
You're drunk, aren't you?  Keep it in moderation.
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
"In moderation" doesn't sound like the words of a drunken general.
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
I'm not a strong drinker, but since it's a happy day, I feel like I should
drink...
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Don't overdo it, don't overdo it.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Mr. Zahar drinks so modestly. Does that mean he has some regrets in his life?
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Can I die without seeing the restoration of Filard Kingdom?
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
I can't lose to the Jaeger brat!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
What a wonderful way of life!  I was impressed!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Okay, these lines When you die, I'll write them in the history books.
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Mr. Daito! Over here!  Good... I thought you wouldn't come.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
I didn't mean to come, but I thought I'd regret it if I didn't go.
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
Yes, how is Amy's father?
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
I've never returned to Gaul. My letters went unanswered...
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
I see... Do you live alone now ?
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Currently I am working as a boarding house manager.
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
It suits the caring Amy.
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
The room is empty, so if you'd like, Daito-san too...
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
I appreciate your feelings, but don't worry about me.
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Yeah... But if you have any problems, please contact me.
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Oh, I promise.
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
Valerie Are you continuing your research?
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
Well, somehow I can't go back to university I have to collect all the materials
again.
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
There are some researchers I have personal connections with, so I'm managing
somehow.
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
For example... What about the research on the Calamity of Darcus?
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
You know that Princess Cordelia declared herself a Dalxian, right?
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
Is that what you were talking about as the hidden truth?
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
Yes, the false history of the Landgris family.
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
With the publication of Princess Cordelia, the historical research of the Darcus
people will progress at an accelerated pace.
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
The world surrounding the Dalxians will definitely change.
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
I'm just asking... Would you be willing to let me cooperate with Valerie's
research?
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
You?
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
Even after the war ended I continued to live without finding any reason to live 
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
If even I can do something...
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
You can do it!
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
Researching the history of Darcus requires the power of the Darcus people.
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
Let's open the door to a new history together!
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
...Thank you
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
Whoa, it's finally here!
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
Hehehe...
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
Before that, let's take a photo!
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
Good!  Then everyone line up around me!
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
Okay, I'm here!
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
I'm behind.
--------------------------------
[00000174][none]
Should I join hands with you?
--------------------------------
[00000175][none]
Drunk people should gather together!  Margit, Ilmari You guys are coming too!
--------------------------------
[00000176][none]
Riera chaaaaaan!
--------------------------------
[00000177][none]
Kurt, come on!
--------------------------------
[00000178][none]
Even before the ceremony, it's completely finished...
--------------------------------
[00000179][none]
That's a problem...
--------------------------------
[00000180][none]
I'm in the front.
--------------------------------
[00000181][none]
Okay, I'll be in the front too.
--------------------------------
[00000182][none]
People like you don't come forward!  Get to the edge!
--------------------------------
[00000183][none]
Elliot, why don't you fold your arms?
--------------------------------
[00000184][none]
I don't refuse invitations from women, but please let me refrain from asking
you.
--------------------------------
[00000185][none]
Then do you want me?
--------------------------------
[00000186][none]
...How much do you have to pay?
--------------------------------
[00000187][none]
I can't seem to get it together.
--------------------------------
[00000188][none]
When Kurt gives an instruction, it's decided in an instant.
--------------------------------
[00000189][none]
There's no time left!  I'll take a picture!  Seino!
--------------------------------
