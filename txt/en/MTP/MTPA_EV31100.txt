[00000001][none]
Okay! ah……
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Nameless is just an easy job!
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
What's so easy about it I'm going on a front-line reconnaissance mission
tomorrow!
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
Zahar's old man  You're in a good mood today too.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
Oh, I'm in a good mood...!  Oh?
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
What, what a waste Hey kid!  Where did I get my sake?
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
I think you broke it yourself. Just do that. You drank a little too much.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Why are you drinking too much?  Toward the General  What kind of way do you ask?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
Yes, yes, General.  I'm going to take a break now.  It's time.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
Oh, really?  I see... ugh
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
Like this Tomorrow's strategy Are you okay...
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
He's a former mercenary, but he's definitely skilled.
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
Sent to Nameless due to a disturbance involving alcohol.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
It can't be helped if it's swallowed and swallowed. It's sent without a name.
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
You'll break your body if you sleep here ...I'll carry you to your room.
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
I'll help you
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Okay, I'll lift it up.
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
Long live Filardo!
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Wow!?
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
I was surprised.  ...Are you talking in your sleep?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
...Guh
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Filardo is a country that was destroyed by the Empire in World War I.
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Mr. Zahar  It is said that he is from the Kingdom of Filardo. 
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
Guuu...gaa
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
You look happy.  I wonder if I'm even dreaming of a destroyed country ...?
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
after a short break  Start reconnaissance mission
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Everyone, don't neglect your preparations.
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Kurt...  It was loud and eventually  My head is pounding.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
Was it loud?  It's the same as usual.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Noisy kid!  That's why I told you not to shout!
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
I haven't stopped drinking yet.
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
Be stupid!  It's still not enough
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Until that happens  Don't drink...
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Did you hear more?  Commander of the Southern Area Story of Jaeger
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
That fierce general, Jaeger, seems to love actual combat and sometimes goes to
the front lines.
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
I don't want to run into that.
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Hey...  What did you just say? Who's the commander?
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Huh?  Yega...
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Jaeger traitor!
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
What is a traitor?  Jaeger is an enemy to begin with. He's the commander of the
Empire.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
That kid  I'm a Philardian. I was a soldier from my homeland.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
Filard was destroyed in the previous war.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
I've known since Kochitora Jaeger was dripping piss.
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Is it a relative's uncle...
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
That damn kid wagging his tail at the Empire.
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Wait a minute What's that liquor bottle in your hand?  Are you still drinking?
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
Can you survive this without drinking it!
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Please don't drink!  Sometimes I'm going to scout from now on!
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Hey, what are you doing!? Give it back!
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
If you give it back, you'll drink it!  I'll dispose of this.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Oh... Ugh...!
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Man crying!?
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Sorry! overdid it! 
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
Jaeger's...  You idiot!
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
That’s it!!
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Giving in to the Empire...!  Uh, uh... oooooo!
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Are you crying?  Are you okay, Zahar?
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Wow  Let's rest until the reconnaissance starts 
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
By teaming up with the Empire... Is it possible to restore the homeland?  ...Ugh
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
Scouting is pretty unpleasant.
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
That's right. We go to places where there is no information and gather
information.
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
Once the alcohol wears off it's decent.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
No matter if there's alcohol or not, I'm decent!  What is reconnaissance in the
first place...
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Quiet!
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Hey!  Listen to my story!
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Wait... Can't you hear anything?
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
Tank?
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Did the troops hate it?
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
From the north?
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Armored troops!  They're overrunning the village!
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
What!? They're attacking the village!
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
Ke!  Empire!
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Hey, why don't you drink at a time like this?  Stop it!
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Noisy!
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
If I don't drink, my hands won't stop shaking and I won't be able to think
properly!
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Stop it!  Hey!
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Ugh... That's good, you're smart.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Hey Kurt!  Where's Kurt!
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
What's up Zahar?
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
The Imperial Army's armored forces are reluctant!
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
I know I'm planning a strategy now...
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
No need to think about it!  Let's attack from here!
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
What!?
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
Destroy the village!  That guy didn't notice our scout at all!
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
At times like this the only thing you can do is take the initiative!
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
No matter how many tanks there are a complete surprise attack is strong!
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Those who harm civilians will destroy the pride of the military!
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Hmm... Good idea.  Adopt Zahar's strategy
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Is it okay!? Isn't it better to think about it properly?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Zahar's experience and situational judgment are trustworthy.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Above all, speed is the key to a surprise attack. If you hesitate, you will miss
the opportunity.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Well said!  Let's go, you bastards!  I'm going to attack that imperial bastard!
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
Zahar has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 "Thoughts for the Motherland" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
The battle is over I won, but...
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
It's a losing battle!  Damn it!
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
You couldn't protect the village residents...
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
As Zahar said If we didn't attack right away, we would have suffered more
casualties.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
Imperial Army...!  What did the people of this village do?
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
Zahar, please stop drinking.
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Shut up, kid!
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
I've been watching this for a long time!
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
It's unavoidable for soldiers to kill each other!
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
But what actually happens?  How many civilians were involved and died!?
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Mr. Zahar...
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
What do you think happened to Filard, the eagle's homeland?
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
The land was ravaged mercilessly Those who fought for the homeland were all
executed!
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
That's the Empire's way!
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Gaul must not lose We cannot give birth to a second Filard...
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Zahar, were you fighting with such feelings...
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Sorry, let me drink.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
My sadness doesn't seem to go away today.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
Kurt, what Zahar is drinking are the tears of the dead. Is that okay?
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
...I'll leave it to the head chef. I'll compile the battle records .
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Jaeger...  You bastard!  Is this your way?
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
Do you really think that your homeland will be revived by teaming up with the
Empire?
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
love the fields, mountains, and rivers  Love your friends, ancestors, and
children That heart will become your country!
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
What kind of heart will be born by teaming up with the Empire?
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
Territory is not a nation!  A nation is made up of people!
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
I think so too Zahar, I'll have a drink with you tonight.
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Me too
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Guuu...gaa
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Uh... Jaeger You are... the pride of the country...
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
I fell asleep.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Leave it alone
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
By the way, do you know this story?
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
The general who was hailed as a hero of Filard Kingdom was
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
He discovered Rady Jaeger's talent, gave him the rank of general, and retired.
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
What is that?
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Is it true that you've known Jaeger since you were a child?
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
Most of the soldiers of the Filard Kingdom were executed except General
Jaeger...
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
this is true
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
In other words, Filard's military personnel who can treat Jaeger like a child...
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
So there aren't many survivors?
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
I didn't expect... this drunk old man Shogun-sama, huh?
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Oh!  I'm the general!
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
Were you awake!?
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
Was he really a general?
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Yes!  I'm a drunkard general!
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
If it's a drinking competition, even Jaeger won't lose!
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
No way...
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
Hahaha, it's the restoration of the homeland.  To the Jaeger boy  I won't lose!
--------------------------------
