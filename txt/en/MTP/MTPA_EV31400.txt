[00000002][none]
I can't do it...
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
Well...
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
It's a regular army escort, right?  Why do you need an escort? That's a joke...
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
This is a unit that gathers up the wounded and retreats to the rear. I won't get
angry.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Even if we're all broken, we won't have to protect you.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Even if you complain the situation won't get better.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Besides, men who do everything without hesitation are popular, right?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
Apparently the regular army is made up of only men but...
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
Let's put today's amount of water into the pot.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
Sigh, if you move around a lot it's hard to take care of potted plants.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
It's quite a beautiful flower That's true...
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
That one is a bit ugly.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Don't get in my sight It's unpleasant.
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
This is rude I'm admiring the flowers Did I interrupt you?
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
That flower looks familiar I can't remember its name.
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
Just like you A ladylike flower So beautiful
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Hmm, it's just unpleasant for someone who doesn't know the value of this flower
to tell you that.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Wait I don't lie to women, do I?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
There is no doubt that you are a liar.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
There is no way that an ordinary person like you would know about this flower.
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
This is a special variety given to me by a certain nobleman...
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
They are different from the flowers sold at flower shops in the city.
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
I know that's why I'm having a hard time remembering.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
That's ridiculous... disappear. It's pointless to talk to an ugly liar.
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Don't say that... Margit, you were an officer in the regular army, weren't you?
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Yes, I'm an elite graduate of the Royal Ranshir Military Academy.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
It's natural for us to be here. We're different from you guys. Don't talk to us
casually.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Is your reason for coming to Nameless different from ours?
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
There's no reason for me to be here This is unfair treatment.
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
If it weren't for my subordinate's failure, I would still be in the regular
army.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
My subordinate's failure...?
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Yes, I'm the victim.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
I don't think so.
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
You gave the order, right?  In that case, aren't you responsible for your
subordinate's failures?
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
There was no mistake in my command!
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Am I responsible for the mismanagement of my subordinate who misunderstood
orders?  That's strange!
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
I guess I don't agree with you after all.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
goodbye
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
This is another tough lady ...I can't leave her alone.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
Oops... that's right I remember.
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
The flower she was growing was 'Royal Mary' .
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
...I never expected that people would comment on me as if I were a nameless
member.
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
That's unintentional!  If things continue like this, my rating will only go
down. 
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
I have to prove that this kind of unit is unsuitable for me...!
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
I'm a former officer... I'll propose a strategy to show you what's different.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
I'll show you what I have as a graduate of the Ranshir Royal Military Academy!
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Hmm...Margit Were you the one who thought of this process ?
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Considering the geography to Landgriz I think this route is the best.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
Unfortunately, this idea cannot be adopted.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Huh... why!?
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
This route will certainly take the time it takes to reach Landgriz.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
But it's too much of a burden on the wounded Regular Army soldiers we're
protecting.
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
As you say, Kurt, any route other than this one is a waste of time.
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
You should shorten the time even if you force the soldiers a little.
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
...Do you really think that?
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
yes
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
In that case, you should go to military academy to study again.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
What...!? What does it mean!?
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
You're only thinking about yourself If that's the case, the team won't move.
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Nah, nah, nah...!
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
What is it?  What kind of flaw is there in my idea ...!
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
Are you angry again?  I want beautiful women to remember to smile 
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
You again!? You show up at the worst possible timing...!
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Did the captain say something about you coming out of the command post?
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
I was also an officer in the regular army!
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
And yet Kurt-san has to start over from the military academy...!
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
The captain also says some harsh things.
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
I'm proud too!  If you hurt me, I won't be able to stay silent!
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Pride, Tokitaka
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Hey Margit What are you proud of as a regular army officer?
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Yes!  Why did I, a regular army officer, have to be humiliated!
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
In that case, you should take this opportunity to see the regular army with your
own eyes once again.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
What!  What's the point of that? What's the point in that?
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
You were an elite regular army officer, weren't you?  If so, you should
definitely be able to see it.
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
Nameless, something that can only be seen from the bottom.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
...I understand!  I don't know what you see 
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
There's no way you can see it and I can't see it!
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
It seems that there is an Imperial Army unit hiding ahead.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
Yes, confirmed by scout report.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
Change course and take a detour to the east mountain road.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
What are you talking about?  Wouldn't that take some time ?
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Safety should be prioritized over time.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Many regular army soldiers are injured and need to avoid combat...
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Why don't you guys just fight?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Not a safer option than a detour
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Go ahead and destroy the enemy forces Our regular army will wait here.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
If all of you are wiped out, I'll take a detour.
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
What...
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
Who said safety should be a priority?
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
This is an order Go ahead and destroy the enemy unit.
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
...hah
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
Should I go first?
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
I wonder when the escort force became an attack force?
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
It's like a magic trick Do you really believe that a handkerchief can turn into
a pigeon?
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
This route is the one I proposed that prioritizes time saving 
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
Forced to break through even though enemy troops are in ambush...
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Is this how the regular army does it?  Is this something a proud regular army
would  do?
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
If we fail with this, the regular army will blame Nameless for everything.
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Responsibility...forcing you to do the task and then imposing the responsibility
on you...?
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
If I fail, it's my subordinate's responsibility... That's just not the same
person I used to be...
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
I have to think of a way to defeat the enemy forces.
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Kurt!
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
What is it, Margit?
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
The route chosen by this regular army is the same as the one I proposed before 
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
That's right.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
May I suggest a way to break through?
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Are you?
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Yes, I think this route is correct.
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
I was also thinking about what to do if I encountered an enemy.
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
But your idea...
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
After my previous proposal was rejected, I reconsidered it to fix the problems!
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
...then let's ask.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
There is a canyon ahead and you cannot run left or right 
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
That's right. You'll be clashing head-on with the enemy force.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
No, there is no need to fight head-on 
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
There is a mountain pass in this canyon that is not shown on the map.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
Really?
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
This area is the territory of a certain nobleman.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
I used to hunt here a lot with that person.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
If you follow the path you used at that time, you can surprise enemy troops from
the flank.
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Kurt-san, would you please adopt this strategy?  I'm sure you'll succeed!
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
...It's not bad, but I won't hire it.
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
That's it!  What's wrong?  Please tell me!
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
In this difficult situation, I seriously thought about a strategy that would
benefit the troops!
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
Still no good?  Am I incompetent?
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
If you're going to go that far, you'll be in charge of the squad this time.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
If you take responsibility you can adopt the plan.
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
Are you prepared to take full responsibility for all your members and the
regular army?
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
……!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Yes!  Please let me do it!!
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Okay, I'll give you command Try it.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
Hey, are you okay...!?
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
This is Margit's plan and she knows this land well 
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Please!  I will make it a success, so please lend me your strength!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
Well, what should we do?
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Even if you tell me to trust you...
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Show me the map Margit, where is the mountain pass located ?
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Alphonse?
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
Since Kurt gave her command, she is the commander.
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
That's right...I'll do the reconnaissance. Alphonse, Please assist Margit.
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
I'll let you do that. Layla, are you worried that Kurt isn't in command?
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
Don't be stupid No matter who's in charge Just win!
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
That's right!  All you have to do is win!
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
It's the captain's decision, so it's probably the best decision. We just follow.
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
I don't think the captain would compromise.
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
Amy is smart!  Do you want those who are messing around  to be educated?
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
No need to tell me!  Let's do it, everyone!
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
Everyone...!
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
You are in charge of everyone's lives, Margit.
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
I-I won...!
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
It was quite a splendid conducting.
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
Mr. Alphonse...
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
I have to apologize to you for all the times I've upset you.
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
No. I don't care about that...
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
I understand now what you were saying.
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
Regular army, officer, elite There was no pride in those titles 
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
Because now I'm proud of
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
It's about everyone who fought together 
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
Thank you Alphonse-san Thanks to you
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
I just said that you should be able to see it.
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
This is what you feel and think about it yourself.
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
I...?
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
Yes, maybe
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
You have a nice face. I think I'm going to fall in love with you.
--------------------------------
[00000174][none]
Mr. Alphonse...
--------------------------------
[00000175][none]
Even if you look cool with that body type, I won't fall in love with you.
--------------------------------
[00000176][none]
I'm sorry. What is Takane no Hana? Is this what you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000177][none]
Damn...
--------------------------------
[00000178][none]
Margit Well done
--------------------------------
[00000179][none]
Kurt...!
--------------------------------
[00000180][none]
This victory and honor is yours.
--------------------------------
[00000181][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000182][none]
The victory was achieved by you directing your strategy.
--------------------------------
[00000183][none]
I have to retract what I said about re-studying at the military academy.
--------------------------------
[00000184][none]
No, if things had stayed the way they were, I wouldn't have changed. It's all
thanks to Kurt.
--------------------------------
[00000185][none]
You should thank the soldiers who fought.
--------------------------------
[00000186][none]
Yes!  I'm going!
--------------------------------
[00000187][none]
Isn't there a good point Captain?
--------------------------------
[00000188][none]
You were the one who made me feel that way, right?
--------------------------------
[00000189][none]
Flowers bloom on their own, which is why they are beautiful.
--------------------------------
[00000190][none]
Yes, like her.
--------------------------------
[00000191][none]
Thank you everyone!
--------------------------------
