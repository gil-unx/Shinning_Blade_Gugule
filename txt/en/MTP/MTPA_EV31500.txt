--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
I think it hurts a little, Please be patient.
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Oh, please do it.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
I'll touch it
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
...Stay!
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
Oh, sorry!
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Don't worry. It just hurt a little more than I expected.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Palpation reveals no abnormalities in the bone. It's just a bruise.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
I'm glad it's a bruise. Shoulders break in weird ways if they're bruised in a
bad spot.
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
You shouldn't take bruises too lightly.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
If you have severe internal bleeding, the blood will pool and swell.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
If you don't cool it properly and heal it quickly you'll feel sorry for your
body.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
Especially if you tend to overdo it Please be gentle with your body 
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
Military people can't help but be very strict with themselves.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
Besides, I'm currently on a mission I can't rest due to some injuries 
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
It's true that you don't get enough rest while on a mission...
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
...Yes The treatment was completed Thank you
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Thank you
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
Hurry up, Felix!  I'm stuck!
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Oh, sorry...hey!
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Not yet?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Please hurry...
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Goho, goho
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Hurry!
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
How long are you guys standing in line!?
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
As part of your daily health management, we urge everyone to visit your doctor
frequently 
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
That's good, but when will Clarissa take a break in this procession ?
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
It's not that hard for me.
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Who told you to be kind to your body?
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
I'm fine. Besides, it's better to be busy right now...
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Is it better to be busy...?
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Yes...
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
Now, rest, rest!  Don't think about work
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Um, are you sure that's okay?
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
It's okay
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
If you were in the treatment tent, someone would come and you wouldn't be able
to rest, right?
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
But...
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
It's okay I was able to make it until you came 
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
As long as no one gets suddenly injured There is no problem.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Sigh...
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
By the way, why did you come to Nameless?
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
I don't see you as the type to do bad things 
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
...I can't say.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
Is it difficult to say?
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Yes...absolutely despised
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
Contempt...?
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
I won't disrespect you You're my friend!
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Isn't it hard to be alone with things you can't tell anyone about?
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Tell me!  Don't worry I won't tell anyone
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
Come on Feel free to come!
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
...I can't say it after all.
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Why?
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
There's no need to go out of your way to be looked down upon.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
...Okay Then let's make one bet.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
If I listen to you and I disrespect you I'll do whatever you say.
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
But if you didn't despise me...
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
What if you don't?
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
I want you to stop forcing yourself to laugh.
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Huh...
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
I understand. Even if your face is smiling, your heart is looking far away.
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
Isn't that so?
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
...Why is that so?
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
You can tell if your friend's smile is real or fake just by looking at it.
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Tell me I want to know why you can't smile properly 
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Mr. Felix...
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Understood
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
I was sent nameless 
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Because I helped the prisoners escape.
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Did you let the Imperial soldiers escape?  Why?
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
...Because I fell in love 
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
That person was seriously injured and taken prisoner.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
I took care of him and nursed him all the time.
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
I was attracted to him as he became more energetic day by day.
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
I don't know why that is.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
However, he was very gentle and thanked me every day.
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Before you know it, words of gratitude turn into words of love.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
I finally got a marriage proposal 
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Imperial soldiers...?
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Of course I refused I will end up with a man from the empire...
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
That can't be allowed 
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
But when I said no, I burst into tears and couldn't stop.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
Clarissa...
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
I apologized to him for lying to the person I love most in the world.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
And I swore I would never lie again.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
...It's a tough choice for both of us Even if we choose to part ways We'll have
to find a way to be together.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Yes... that's why I decided to at least follow my honest feelings.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
He promised to come back for me.
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
I left this and returned to my country.
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Necklace?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
That person is also wearing this and somewhere under this sky they are thinking
of me.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
I believe so
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
I see...
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
...You despised it, didn't you?  I fell in love with an enemy soldier and let
him escape. I can't believe I was waiting for him.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
no disrespect  I guess he was a nice guy. He was
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
yes
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
Isn't that a nice smile That's what I wanted to see 
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
Because talking to Felix made me feel better.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
...Thank you
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
I haven't done anything I hope we can meet again after the war 
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Yes I'm sure we'll meet 
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
Ugh...!  This guy is tough.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Sorry!  Alphonse-san Did it hurt?
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
No, it's fine.  Your hard work is  alleviating the pain.
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
I should have been on guard, but I didn't expect to receive the enemy's power
reconnaissance...!
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
This is the weakness of small units that often act alone.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
I'm not used to being attacked, so my response will be poor.
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
To protect us To everyone  I got hurt...
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Step forward and protect your friends.  In our role
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Your job is to save your injured comrades. You have nothing to apologize for.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
That's what it is  Don't worry about it
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Thank you everyone... I will risk my life to treat you! Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
Dededede!!
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
You're using too much force. You should be gentle. Be gentle.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Empire's powerful reconnaissance force  After being discovered
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
Our plan of attack is  Major modifications were required.
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
Our location was noticed before we could scout the enemy base.
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
You must assume that the enemy has already strengthened its defenses in
preparation for an attack.
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
If we attack, the damage will be more than slight.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
Captain, can't we postpone the attack for a little while longer?
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Everyone, you're already injured in the previous battle. If you continue
fighting like this...
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
HQ's operational instructions cannot be changed.
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
And once the enemy has been detected, it is most important not to give them time
to prepare.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
The attack will be carried out.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
But!
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
It's okay, Clarissa We've always had battles like this.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
And I've always survived don't worry.
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
Felix is ??right We're not going to die 
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
Face the current situation and fight with all your might to find a way out.
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
That's the only way for us to survive.
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
That's nameless...
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
Please don't make that sad face 
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
That's right Beautiful women smile, smile!
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
If I think you'll help me even if I get shot, I have nothing to fear.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Everyone...!
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Understood No matter what, I will definitely help you all!
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
Start attacking at dawn with the morning sun on your back 
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
increases confusion  Decide the match at once  Everyone, prepare for sortie!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Clarissa has awakened
@fcFF008800 ``unwavering love'' @fci instead of 
@fcFF008800 ``his face'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
The battle is over We have narrowly won the victory.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
However, the battle of support soldiers is  The real thing starts from here.
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
It's our job to save as many injured soldiers as possible.
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Clarissa!  There was an injured person!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Over there over the bushes.  I'll be waiting here.
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Huh?  What do you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
...Don't worry about me Just give me the answer.
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
Ugh...
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Wait, are you an imperial soldier?  Why...!
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Clarissa?  Is it Clarissa?
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
That pendant... You!
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
It's me, Clarissa.
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
Didn't you go back to your country?
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
Not allowed to return 
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
I didn't want to fight with you in Gaul ever again...
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
Don't speak I'll take care of you
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
He saw my pendant  He called you...  Ugh
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
Don't move It's okay, the injury is minor.
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
...Thank you
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
Clarissa  Let's run away together
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
You'll open a wound Don't talk.
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
It was fate to meet you again on the battlefield Just the two of us...
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
Please, don't say anything!
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
Clarissa, why?
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
...I just ran away.  I can't be happy
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
I'm fine I don't care how painful it is
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
But now you're running away with a Gaul woman.
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
Who will bless you?
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
Clarissa...
