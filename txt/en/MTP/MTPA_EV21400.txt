[00000000][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Touka-senpai!  Hello.
--------------------------------
[00000001][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Oh, Rage-kun?  Hello.
--------------------------------
[00000002][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Hehe. It's kind of like going back to school.
--------------------------------
[00000003][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Yes.
--------------------------------
[00000004][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Touka-senpai was amazing when I was at school.
--------------------------------
[00000005][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Me?　What was amazing?
--------------------------------
[00000006][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
There was no one in the school who didn't know Touka-senpai, and someone was
always saying hello to him.
--------------------------------
[00000007][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Now that I think about it... maybe it was.
--------------------------------
[00000008][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
What... you don't remember?
--------------------------------
[00000009][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
I feel like I remember...I don't feel like I remember...
--------------------------------
[00000010][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Haha...  I think everyone would be shocked to hear this.
--------------------------------
[00000011][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Shocked?
--------------------------------
[00000012][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
It takes courage to talk to Touka-senpai.
--------------------------------
[00000013][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Hmm. That's right.
--------------------------------
[00000014][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
It was really amazing.  Especially during the time of commuting to and from
school.
--------------------------------
[00000015][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Hmm...  I remember Rage-kun greeting me, but...
--------------------------------
[00000016][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Is that so?  I'm a little happy about that.
--------------------------------
[00000017][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
It's time to go to school...
--------------------------------
[00000018][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Ah, no, no, it's not something I have to force myself to remember.
--------------------------------
[00000019][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Really? Then I won't remember it anymore.
--------------------------------
[00000020][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
………….
--------------------------------
[00000021][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
But I don't think it's anything special.
--------------------------------
[00000022][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Certainly.  Greetings are basic.
--------------------------------
[00000023][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Not really...
--------------------------------
[00000024][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000025][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
It's always been like that.  Both in elementary school and junior high school. 
So for me, that's normal.
--------------------------------
[00000026][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Ah...that's right.
--------------------------------
[00000027][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
But Touka-senpai was truly the person everyone admired.
--------------------------------
[00000028][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
That's too much.
--------------------------------
[00000029][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Actually, I admire him too.  Even though we were going to the same school, we
studied really hard.
--------------------------------
[00000030][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Thank you. happy.
--------------------------------
[00000031][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Ah, yes...
--------------------------------
[00000032][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
………….
--------------------------------
[00000033][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
………….
--------------------------------
[00000034][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(Too bad...the conversation has stopped...
We're talking about something...even though it's just the two of us with Touka-senpai...!)
--------------------------------
[00000035][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Oh, now that I think about it!  At that time, wasn't it a hot topic that there
was a singer who looked like your senior?
--------------------------------
[00000036][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
I remember that.  I was asked many times if it was real.
--------------------------------
[00000037][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
As expected?  They looked very similar!
--------------------------------
[00000038][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
………….
--------------------------------
[00000039][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Ah... I don't like people saying we look alike, do I?  I've been mistaken many
times...I'm sorry.
--------------------------------
[00000040][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Huh? "You don't like it at all, do you?"  I didn't dislike her songs.  In fact,
I was happy.
--------------------------------
[00000041][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Now, I was remembering a song that was popular back then.
--------------------------------
[00000042][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Oh, good.
--------------------------------
[00000043][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
I've been listening to a lot of different songs...
--------------------------------
[00000044][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Touka-senpai really likes singing...
--------------------------------
[00000045][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(Didn't you hear that...
But it feels nostalgic, like this.
Touka-senpai, you haven't changed at all from back then...)
--------------------------------
[00000046][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(It's been a while since I last talked,
I'm glad we were able to talk slowly...
I want to talk again.)
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
Don't you remember?
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
It was really amazing
--------------------------------
[00000049][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Ah, Touka-senpai.  Did you go shopping?
--------------------------------
[00000050][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Yeah. that's right.
--------------------------------
[00000051][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Shall I carry my luggage?
--------------------------------
[00000052][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Oh, thank you.
--------------------------------
[00000053][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
It's nothing like this.
--------------------------------
[00000054][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
What's inside this?
--------------------------------
[00000055][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Ufufu, that's a secret.  There are many secrets when it comes to shopping for
girls.
--------------------------------
[00000056][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I-I see.
--------------------------------
[00000057][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(When you say that, I get even more curious...)
--------------------------------
[00000058][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Now that I think about it...
--------------------------------
[00000059][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
...?
--------------------------------
[00000060][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
This has happened before, right?
--------------------------------
[00000061][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Yes. I remember.  I remember very well when I asked what was in the bag and they
told me it was a ``secret.''
--------------------------------
[00000062][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
That time too, I met Rage-kun on my way home from shopping, right?
--------------------------------
[00000063][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
That's right.  That day was the day I had a big fight with my sister,  so I
still remember it.
--------------------------------
[00000064][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Yeah.  After that, Kanon-san was complaining.
--------------------------------
[00000065][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I-Is that so?  I didn't know...
--------------------------------
[00000066][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
………….
--------------------------------
[00000067][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Oh, you don't remember?
--------------------------------
[00000068][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
No!  I was surprised that Touka-senpai remembered me...
--------------------------------
[00000069][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Really?
--------------------------------
[00000070][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Oh, it's true!
--------------------------------
[00000071][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Is that so?
--------------------------------
[00000072][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Oh, you don't remember?
--------------------------------
[00000073][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Ah, no, there are a lot of similar things, but I can't really say...
--------------------------------
[00000074][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
I see.
--------------------------------
[00000075][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Indeed, when I was in Elde, I often asked her to go shopping with me.
--------------------------------
[00000076][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I'm carrying luggage though.
--------------------------------
[00000077][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Did you not like it?
--------------------------------
[00000078][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Not at all! It was a lot of fun!
--------------------------------
[00000079][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
That would be fine.
--------------------------------
[00000080][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(There's no way I didn't like it...
It's true that we were kept together for hours, but
I was...)
--------------------------------
[00000081][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(I felt proud just walking alongside Touka-senpai...)
--------------------------------
[00000082][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Yes.  I wanted to ask Touka-senpai...
--------------------------------
[00000083][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000084][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
When I was walking with Touka-senpai, I often hummed...
--------------------------------
[00000085][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
I guess so?
--------------------------------
[00000086][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I thought that song was really good.  I want to listen to it again...
--------------------------------
[00000087][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Hmm...I wonder what...?  I forgot.
--------------------------------
[00000088][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I see...
--------------------------------
[00000089][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Do you remember what kind of melody it is?
--------------------------------
[00000090][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Uh...I'm sorry.  I remember that it's a really good song, but the melody...
--------------------------------
[00000091][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
That's all I can't remember.
--------------------------------
[00000092][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
That's right.  If you just listen to it, you'll understand right away.
--------------------------------
[00000093][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
In any case...  If you're in this world, you won't have a chance to hear it.
--------------------------------
[00000094][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
...That's right.
--------------------------------
[00000095][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
In order to hear Elde's song, we need to make this world peaceful soon.
--------------------------------
[00000096][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Yes!  Oh, that's right!
--------------------------------
[00000097][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Yeah?
--------------------------------
[00000098][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
When we return to Elde, would you please sing that song I said again?
--------------------------------
[00000099][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Yeah. OK. 
--------------------------------
[00000100][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
...?
--------------------------------
[00000101][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
But then, like before, could you go shopping with me?
--------------------------------
[00000102][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Of course!
--------------------------------
[00000103][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Hehe. I'm looking forward to it.
--------------------------------
[00000104][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
I remember
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Is that so?
--------------------------------
[00000107][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Touka-senpai?
--------------------------------
[00000108][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Oh, Rage-kun.  Is it for something?
--------------------------------
[00000109][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
No, Touka-senpai was there, so I thought we could talk.
--------------------------------
[00000110][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Yes.  That makes me happy.  What kind of story do you want to talk about?
--------------------------------
[00000111][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Yes...
--------------------------------
[00000112][フェンリル,,フェンリル]
Rage! Enemy attack!
--------------------------------
[00000113][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
What!
--------------------------------
[00000114][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Let's go! Rage-kun!  Let's talk later!
--------------------------------
[00000115][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Oh, I understand!  Taku! At times like this!
--------------------------------
[00000116][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
This way?
--------------------------------
[00000117][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
It's supposed to be... but isn't it?  I'm sorry, Rage-kun.  I'm making you take
a lot of time.
--------------------------------
[00000118][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I'm fine!  I'm really fine now!!
--------------------------------
[00000119][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Really? That would be fine.
--------------------------------
[00000120][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Rather...!  Oh, no...
--------------------------------
[00000121][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Rather?
--------------------------------
[00000122][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I-I'm so happy to be able to walk with Touka-senpai...
--------------------------------
[00000123][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Oh, thank you.  I'm also very happy to have time alone with Rage-kun.
--------------------------------
[00000124][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Ah, thank you...
--------------------------------
[00000125][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(Wow, I'm so nervous)
--------------------------------
[00000126][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Huh? Is that...a radio?
--------------------------------
[00000127][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
That's true. It's like a small radio.
--------------------------------
[00000128][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Why are you here...?
--------------------------------
[00000129][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
This works!
--------------------------------
[00000130][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Wow...I'm surprised.  It must have come from Elde, under the influence of the
Chaos Gate.
--------------------------------
[00000131][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
It seems so.
--------------------------------
[00000132][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000133][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(This song...maybe!?)
--------------------------------
[00000134][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(That's right...
That time...when I was in Elde...
That's the song that Touka-senpai was singing.)
--------------------------------
[00000135][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
This is it!  This is it!  The song I was saying the other day!
--------------------------------
[00000136][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Hehehe~♪ Hehehehe~♪ Hehehehe♪
--------------------------------
[00000137][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Yes! That's it!
--------------------------------
[00000138][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Yes, you were talking about this song.  Yes, it's definitely my favorite song. 
Come to think of it, I used to sing a lot back then...
--------------------------------
[00000139][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Touka-senpai...
--------------------------------
[00000140][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000141][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Can you sing for me?
--------------------------------
[00000142][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
...Ufufu.  It's a little embarrassing.  But...yeah. OK.
--------------------------------
[00000143][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(So nostalgic...
I never thought I'd be able to hear this song again in a place like this...)
--------------------------------
[00000144][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(I liked listening to this song...
This song is sung by Touka-senpai...)
--------------------------------
[00000145][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(No, I mean,
I loved watching Touka-senpai sing this song...)
--------------------------------
[00000146][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(Even though it was right in front of me,
it was so bright that I felt like I couldn't get close to it...)
--------------------------------
[00000147][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(I knew that my senpai was too pretty and that I couldn't reach her...)
--------------------------------
[00000148][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(Just watching my seniors sing made me feel happy)
--------------------------------
[00000149][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(I see...I guess so)
--------------------------------
[00000150][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
@fcFFAAFFAA(I'm talking about Touka-senpai...)
--------------------------------
[00000151][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Senpai!
--------------------------------
[00000152][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Huh? what happened?
--------------------------------
[00000153][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
...You were my first love.
--------------------------------
[00000154][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Huh!?
--------------------------------
[00000155][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
...Yes.
--------------------------------
[00000156][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Thank you.  I was surprised at how sudden it was, but I'm very happy about that
feeling.
--------------------------------
[00000157][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Oh, I'm sorry.  Suddenly...
--------------------------------
[00000158][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
No. never mind.
--------------------------------
[00000159][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
I see...
--------------------------------
[00000160][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
So, are you there now?
--------------------------------
[00000161][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000162][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Someone I like.
--------------------------------
[00000163][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Oh, that's...
--------------------------------
[00000164][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
Does that mean you have that reaction?
--------------------------------
[00000165][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Oh no...what's going on?
--------------------------------
[00000166][トウカ,クレハ,トウカ]
What do you think?  Hehehe.
--------------------------------
[00000167][レイジ,レイジ,レイジ]
Aha…ahahahaha….
--------------------------------
