[00000001][none]
Sei! Hi!
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Ha!　Yes!
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
Phew... I'm feeling great again this morning!
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
Oh, I'm hungry!  I can't wait for breakfast.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
That's where the healthy vegetables come from!  Charge your power with crunchy
vegetables!
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Mumble... Hmm...delicious!  Alright, it's all over!
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Let's fight all day today!
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
I've been feeling good since this morning 
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
Good morning!  Are you going for a morning walk?
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
No, I woke up because you were so noisy.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
Acha!? I'm sorry!
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
It's early in the morning for the old woman I don't care.
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
That's right!  Getting up early is good for your health!
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
I heard that the next strategy will be hard so let's keep our spirits up!
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Strategy...?  Oh, it was the suppression of the resistance 
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Taking advantage of the chaos of war and plotting to overthrow the country,
these people are idiots.
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Those people are former soldiers of the Gallic army, right?
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
Why did you start a rebellion?
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
People who were dissatisfied with the country are getting carried away.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
But rumors say the resistance is very strong.
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
I guess If not, I won't let you do it.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
I wonder how strong it will be I'm looking forward to it!
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Are you looking forward to it?  Even though the other members are worried 
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
Yes!  I want to become even stronger!!
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
That's why I want to fight against strong opponents and master my own strength!
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
She's a hot child, at all.
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Even if you become stronger, good men won't come to you, right?
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
No problem!
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
I just want to catch up with the person I admire 
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Someone you admire?  Are you in love with me?
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
That's not it!  I just want to be recognized for my strength 
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
It's like that!
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Looks like you're quite a weirdo too.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Really?
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
So, how did someone like you come to Nameless?
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
It doesn't look like it's going to do anything bad, does it?
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Actually, I... I beat up a thug who came into contact with me on the street.
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
I was arrested on charges of being overly defensive.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
So I didn't really understand I signed the document and ended up here...
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
What does it mean for a young girl to be overly defensive when dealing with a
ruffian?
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
I'm sure you've done a lot of work 
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
That's not true!  I just wanted to punish you!
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
But... When I got a little serious I passed out...
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Looks like I committed unilateral violence 
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
You regret it, right?  This is what happened
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
I have no regrets!  It's the result of doing the right thing 
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
I don't dislike this unit either.
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
If I stay here, I feel like I can become stronger!
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Well, you're a weirdo after all.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
Really?
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Gloria-san, would you like to eat this with me?
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Raw carrots...?  What's wrong with this?
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Ehehe When I stopped by the village, I got some for you.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
Because it's fresh It's delicious!
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Hmm... mumble Yes, this chewy texture!  It really tastes like the earth!
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
A young girl chomping on a raw carrot... You're really funny.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
The person I admire told me 
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
It is said that if you eat a lot of vegetables every day, you will become
stronger!
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Vegetables?  Is the person you admire a farmer?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
No, he's a military man.
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
He is the person who saved me when I was 7 years old!
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
I'll become stronger like that person!
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
What will you do when you become stronger?
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Of course, we protect the weak in the same way!
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
I think so.
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
If you're not strong, you can't protect anything You can't carry out justice.
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
Follow justice, hey.
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
I was weak when I was 7, so I had to be protected.
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
If so, just get stronger!  I've always believed that !
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
...Then Anika Can I ask you something?
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
yes
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
What do you think of weak and righteous people?
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
That's...
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Just powerless.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Just powerless...?
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
The righteous must win!
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Justice is not justice unless it wins.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Hmm, I see.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
It's well said that being young is dangerous...
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
There have been reports that the Resistance has launched a terrorist attack in
the city.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
We will move towards suppression.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
The Resistance takes advantage of the fact that it is a former regular army and
lets their guard down.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
A very dangerous opponent who carries out destructive activities all at once.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
I must have had the pride of being a former military man.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
I don't know what kind of attack it will launch Be careful.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Hehe...!  That means the enemy is powerful!  I'm so excited!
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
It might be more correct to say that it's brutal rather than powerful, but...
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Either is fine!  If we win this battle We'll become even stronger...!
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Let's show off our power! Let's do it!
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Oh my, "power"...
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Annika Keep your head down a little.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
People are being killed in the city right now.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
How can you be excited at a time like that?
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Well... Because you can fight against strong enemies!
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
I want to fight strong enemies and become even stronger...
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
...Listen, Anika I don't hate you.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
I know you're an honest girl.
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
But, if things continue as they are now, you won't be able to gain true strength
.
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
I want you to understand that 
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
True strength...?
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
What do you mean!  Please tell me!
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
It's not something you can teach. You'll have to figure it out yourself.
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Gloria!
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
That's it We have to hurry to the scene.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Sortie!
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
Annika has awakened
@fcFF008800 ``true strength'' @fci instead of 
@fcFF008800 ``wildly rushing forward'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
The suppression was successful, but were they unable to capture everyone?
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
The decision at the end of the day is like that of a former regular army
officer.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Even so, the number of bodies is staggering There is no mercy for women and
children...
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Couldn't stop the city from being set on fire Weapons are sometimes powerless.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
What's the resistance?  You bastards...!
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Even civilians were massacred indiscriminately!  Isn't it worse than the
imperial army!
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
It's not a massacre...!
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
What about you!? Survival!
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
We are just...  The only thing that can prove that is ``power''...
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
You idiot...!  What is "power" for?  What for...!!
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
Okay... that guy can't hear me anymore.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
I know!  But...!
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
The city was burnt down It looks like a ruin... Even the lives of children were
taken away...
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Annika, this is the "power" you seek.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
Ugh...!
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
``Power'' If you don't know how to use it It's just a nuisance.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
What would happen if a 3 year old had a gun?  That's what it is.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
If you want power, use it properly.
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
If you don't do that, you'll end up just like the Resistance.
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
That's it!!
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
I don't want to see you like that 
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
Uh...
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
You are still young You have to worry a lot You have to train properly.
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
Strength of heart
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
The strength of the heart...?
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Remember that It's called ``justice.''
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Justice...ah!!
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
I think I understand now!  What is true strength?
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
Mind and body, no matter which one is missing, you won't have true strength!
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
I was inexperienced I was no good at all!
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
What's wrong? I've already found the answer ...
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
I need to train more!  Starting from scratch!
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
So what is this?
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Tuition fees!  It's a carrot!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
Tuition fees!?
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Well, I've been thinking about a lot of things.
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
I don't know how to train my mind at all, so...
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
I'll give you lots of carrots!  Please make me your disciple!
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
...She's really an interesting kid.
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Cook the carrots before you bring them back. Then I'll make you my apprentice.
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Yes! Master!!
--------------------------------
