--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
This time's mission is outrageous It seems like the enemy is a villainous unit.
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
They kill everyone they meet... They slaughter women and children without mercy.
They say they're the worst kind of people.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
But, more than that, this bland food is the worst for me.
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
Aren't you happy just being able to eat?
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
Look, there are some people who eat that deliciously.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Hmm... delicious
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Giselle-chan... Is this poor portable food really that tasty?
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Giselle-chan Can I have a moment?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
...What?
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
No, you look like you're eating a meal like this, so I'm curious.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
I think this is delicious.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
If you think this is delicious then try my cooking next time.
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
I'm sure I can impress you even more.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
...No, it's fine.
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Why?  Don't you want to eat something delicious?
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Not interested
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
I'm satisfied with this meal I don't need anything else 
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
The food is tastier than the food there.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
The food over there...?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
I've been in prison for a long time.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Prison...!? What the hell did you do?
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Is it necessary to talk about it?
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
...No, I won't force it.
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
Please give the delicious food to someone else.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Excuse me
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
I was surprised... to think that there were people in this world who weren't
interested in food...
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Giselle... Isn't the prisoner gone?
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
I'm interested in that mysterious atmosphere.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
I secretly observed her for a few days.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Oh, so?
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
Again, her life is extremely simple and has no character.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
I guess you could say it feels like you're alone in a prison.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
If you don't feel like you have a particular hobby 
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
Communication with other members is also poor...
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Not particularly close to anyone Not particularly hostile to anyone
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Does that mean you have no interest in everything?
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Does such a person really exist?
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Not really for me, I can't believe it.
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
Well, if there's nothing, there's no way it'll be sent nameless.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
Besides, you must have at least one favorite food.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
I think I'll look into her for a while.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
That's fine, but don't go too far.
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
I know!
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
Hi Gisele
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Is it you again?
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
What are you doing here?
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
I was watching the bonfire.
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
Bonfire?
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
When I see a bonfire, I immediately associate it with cooking.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
...Well, weren't you interested? It's already late, so I think you should go to
sleep.
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
...No, I'm not tired 
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
But we can't stay here forever, right?
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
...that's fine
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
If I get sleepy, I'll sleep here Don't worry about it
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Is it okay to sleep outdoors...
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Maybe you don't want to go back to your room?
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Are there any members who are not good at it...?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
I have never had that kind of consciousness.
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
Hmm... What's going on in this girl's head 
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
chuckle...
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
...huh?
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
You're doing well today too...
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Who are you talking to?
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
This feeling of something burning... It's very calming...
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
Maybe...
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Were you talking to the bonfire?  No way...
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
The target enemy force is currently advancing on this plain.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Take advantage of this period and launch a surprise attack!
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
That villainous unit!
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
As I explained before, you don't know what the enemy will do ...be careful.
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Of course
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Those who enjoy pointless slaughter will be thoroughly beaten down.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Ah, this strategy will succeed at all costs.
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Captain
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
calmly
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
It's natural for you to be a little angry because you're the other person Isn't
it natural to feel some anger?
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
...I don't really understand 
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
No matter who you are, your enemy is your enemy I don't think it's anything more
or less .
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
The enemy is the enemy?
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
I'm trying to say that the enemy is neither good nor bad.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
Is this indifference a feeling unique to criminals...?
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
But what did she do to spend so long in prison?
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
Preparing for battle Watch out for the enemy's appearance.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Oh!
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Is Gisele good too?
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
yes
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
...The only thing that can get hot is the flame that has the power to burn
everything down.
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
Otherwise the heat will burn itself It will be a double-edged sword.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
...hehe
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
I can smell gunpowder on the wind...
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
Giselle has awakened to her potential @fcFF008800 "friend" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
For such a villainous unit, you escaped easier than I expected...
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Kurt What do you do next?
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
It's hard to imagine that the brutal forces we've heard about will retreat so
easily.
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
It could be a trap. Let's take a look.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
...As expected of you, Captain That's a wise decision.
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
But you've already fallen into the trap 
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Gisele, what do you mean?
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
It feels very nice 
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
Look, don't you understand This scent...
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Scent...?
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
What the hell is that scent?
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Very nice scent I love it
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
Look, a beautiful flower has bloomed 
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Flowers!? It's an explosion!
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
It's gone!  Maybe it was the smell of oil and gunpowder!
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Evacuate!
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
No, it's already surrounded by flames on all sides.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
That unit... did you intend to burn this whole plain to the ground!?
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Fufufu, beautiful...
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
What should I do? There's no escape!
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
Giselle...!  If you knew about this ruse, why didn't you report it?
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
...Because if I told you, this flower would never bloom.
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
It's beautiful... Why is it so beautiful?
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
Look, those kids are so happy So cute...
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
Giselle, You seem to know a lot about fire. Is there a way to put out this fire?
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Why do you want to delete it?
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Even though she's so beautiful... Aren't those kids sad?
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
Giselle, this is an order.
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
I see... then I guess it can't be helped.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Everyone please wait here I'll go.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
You put out all that flame by yourself...
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
How did you do it?
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
I pick up the food There's not much food here I get hungry quickly...
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
Does that mean there is less to burn?
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
This will put a hungry child to sleep.
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
I don't know if you're carrying around a fire extinguisher or something like
that...
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
Ufufu, what should I do to make them happy? What should I do to make them sad?
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
I know you very well...
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Originally, this happened because you didn't report it. 
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
If it wasn't for her, the damage would be even bigger.
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
I don't think we could have stopped all of that massive explosion and flames.
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
Hehe, this unit is the best No one gets angry even if we play with fire...
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
By the way, Giselle-chan, Is it true that you were in prison all this time for a
crime...?
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
...That's strange, isn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
I was just playing with those kids 
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
Oh, I guess...
--------------------------------
