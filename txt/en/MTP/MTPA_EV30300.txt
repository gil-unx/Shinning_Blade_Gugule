[00000001][none]
Sei! Hello!! Sei!! Hello!
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Teeeeeeeeeeee!
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
Okay, warm-up is over!  Now, let's begin the real training!
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
Anika-chan is doing well today as well.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
Yes!  My only strength is my energy!
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
So it can't be helped if it gets sent nameless 
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Haha... I went a little too far.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Did you blow away the street thugs?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
I like fighting, so I'm getting a little too excited.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
I'm scared. I can't mess with Anika-chan.
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
She's an ugly girl who doesn't suit her face. I feel a little sorry for the
person who got hurt. 
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
When I tried to get serious, it just turned out to be one-sided!
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
The other person was a bad guy, wasn't he?  Isn't it self-defense?
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
If there is a difference in ability I have to make adjustments.
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Don't do it to the point where it's considered overly defensive.
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Oh...
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Are you guys having fun bullying an innocent girl?
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
That's not my intention...
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Almost everyone in this unit is guilty of something.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Isn't it lacking in dandyism to poke at that?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Hey, food thief?
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Are you talking about me?
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Actually, I also got dumped by a woman, got drunk and broke a table at a
restaurant.
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
It seems like you're doing a lot of things. Isn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
Hey!  How do you know what happened before you joined the volunteer army?
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Hey, it's just a hobby.
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
That lady is doing something as bad as the number of stars, right?
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Say things you wouldn't say in front of a girl.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
Hmm, so what?
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
So I was arrested for illegally acquiring personal information.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Isn't that an appropriate charge for an information geek?
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
It's not the crime of having an affair with an aristocratic lady. Don't be
mistaken.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
You have a face you can flirt with!
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
You don't understand that you shouldn't judge people by their appearance.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
What I'm trying to say is that no innocent person can be healed.
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Everyone makes mistakes People grow from them 
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Mr. Alphonse!  Wow, that's cool!  It's the best!
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Anika-chan Are you serious?!
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
It's cool to be silent It's the opposite, right?
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
Sir Waldo, hey.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
I had no idea that that bastard was reaching outside the country.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
I hope it doesn't become a problem...
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
Ugh... I'm in trouble...
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Where did you drop it...
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
Oh?  What's wrong, Anika?
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
If you look like that, your beauty will be ruined, right?
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
Mr. Alphonse...
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Looks like you're in trouble. You're called the Gallic Falcon. Do you need my
help?
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
No, it's fine I'll do something by myself.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
That's it!
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Your straight eyes are so beautiful as you try to solve the problem on your
own...
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
But I can't ignore the cloudy eyes.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
There isn't... I can't find it after all.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
What should I do...
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Hi, Annika
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
Mr. Alphonse... We met again. Is there something you need from me?
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
Sorry I found it before you did 
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Isn't this what you're looking for?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
Ah!!
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
I dropped the ``bell'' that was a keepsake of my father!  Where did you get
this!?
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
My good friend cat was playing with this ``Rin''.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
Thank you!  But how did you know that what you were looking for was a bell?
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Last time I met you, I heard a little bit of a bell ringing from you.
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
I couldn't hear that earlier, so it struck me.
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
It's amazing that you remembered that !
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
I'm a former private investigator.
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Were you a detective?
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Insight and memory are the basics of detective work.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Well...because I was too passionate about that detective business.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
I got caught stealing personal information and was assigned to Nameless.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
Information nerds were a temporary form to deceive the public eye!
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
That's cool!  I respect you!
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
On the outside, it's me with a picnic face.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
He's surprisingly cool behind the scenes, isn't he?
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Picnic face?
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Just keep smiling like a fat guy stuffing your face with bread at a picnic.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Isn't that also to deceive the public eye?  It's cool!
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Right?
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
The face is something you are born with 
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
Our mission this time is to escort Lord Waldo to a safe location.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
Please leave as soon as possible I'm in a hurry.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
Ha
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
...a safe place, right?
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
...You over there I think you wanted to say something?
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
No, I don't think it's normal to need a military escort.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Isn't it wartime now? Who knows what will happen ?
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
You know what's going to happen, so you're sending the military to protect you.
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
What...?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
No, it's a great honor to be able to protect someone of such stature as to be
able to mobilize an army.
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Well, please put my safety first.
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Of course
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
Report from the scout!  It seems that there is a group of armed men hiding in
the forest ahead!
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
Hiding in the forest...?
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
I guess it's okay?  If any harm comes to me,  everyone will be sentenced to
death!
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
As you say, Lord Waldo When you are injured,
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
Even if you don't execute them I think this unit will be wiped out 
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
That means you're also dead.
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
What...!
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
I'm more concerned about the enemy than that.
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
For a mere thief, the ambush is too well prepared.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
That's probably because he's not just a thief.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
New information has arrived from the scout!
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
The group in front are not bandits, but the Imperial Army...!
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
Imperial army?  In a place like this?
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
As expected...
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
What?  Why are you looking at me!?
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Alphonse Maybe you did know?
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Oops I'm concentrating on the battle now.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Taking this nobleman to a safe place is the top priority, right?
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Yes!  It's your job to ensure my safety !
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
Understood Everyone, prepare for battle!
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Alphonse has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 "Famous Reasoning" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
I ensured safety, but... The enemy was clearly targeting Lord Waldo... Why?
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
Isn't that because this nobleman is a bad person?
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
W-what do you say!?
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
I had no idea you were the famous ``vampire aristocrat'' 
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
What...!?
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
What is a ``vampire aristocrat''?
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
There are nobility who like bribes No matter who they are, they will demand
money or goods from them.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
The nickname I got was ``Vampire Aristocrat.''
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
How does a soldier like you know that!?
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
I once had a friend who refused to give you a bribe and was killed.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
I've been looking into it ever since.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
There hasn't been much activity in the country recently I thought they were
being quiet, but it turned out they were sucking blood from outside.
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
...Shut up!  Don't talk any more!!
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
This guy was making a lot of money by communicating with the Imperial Army and
passing on information about the Gallic Army.
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
The reason you're going to the port is to flee the country, right?
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
What, what evidence do you have for doing something like that...!
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
I was targeted by the Imperial Army because I knew too much information about
the Empire.
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
This letter states that you will sell information about the Empire and Gaul to
the country you are fleeing to.
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
Why is that letter here...!?
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Don't miss suspicious mail It's common sense for detectives.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Does that mean Lord Waldo is a traitor?
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Wait!  Help me!  That's right, I'll pay you!
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
How much do you want?  Tell me!
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
I'm sorry, but for us, the mission is more important than the money.
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Deliver you to the safest location to complete the mission.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
The safest and most secure place in this country is the prison.
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
Geez!?
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
I'd like you to properly pursue the extra crimes and clean yourself up before
you go to the execution stand.
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
That's fine. I'll make sure to send it to you. Don't worry, Lord Waldo.
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
That... why would I be like this...!
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Remember, my big belly is filled with dreams and information.
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Alphonse-san... He's really cool...!
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
Alphonse Did you do this kind of work before?
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Yeah, I worked as a detective, investigating corruption among aristocrats and
politicians, and corruption in the military.
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Isn't it naive to want to improve the country with your own power?
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
How is it now?
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
As you can see, I've always been a pale fat man.
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
A Gallic falcon who deceives people and corrects wrongs. How about it, isn't it
cool?
--------------------------------
