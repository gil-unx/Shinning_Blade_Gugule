@fcFFFFF5F0@dc9F555555@db2@dt1@lt1Seireki 1935 Varias Chubu
--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
The next mission is in the Varias Desert.  It's reconnaissance!
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Ah, it seems that Imperial Army troops are showing up.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
Desert... it's the worst
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
What's the point in a place with nothing but ruins from such a long time ago?
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
What are you talking about?  The Barias Desert is an extremely important land in
ancient history.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
You know about the Calamity of Darcus, right?
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
2000 years ago, the Darcians
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Burned down 100 cities, 1 million people, and livestock.
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
The city that flourished in the land of Barias was destroyed by the Darxians.
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
It is said that it became a desert like it is now ...
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
The great disaster brought about by the Darxians... This is the disaster of the
Darxians.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
Are you enjoying talking like that around me?
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
I'm just telling you a popular theory. How you interpret this theory is up to
you.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
If it's academic, whatever you say is okay?
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
The scholar teacher is  When it comes to history, I get absorbed in it.
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
I didn't mean any harm.  If I offended you, I apologize.
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
It's fine...
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
What are the ruins?  Is it because the Imperial Army is wandering around because
it's also treasure?
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Ancient Darcian dwellings still remain in the Barias Desert.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
The Empire hates Darxians more than Gaul, right?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Are they going to search the houses of the Dalxians?
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
We don't know where important historical discoveries are buried.
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
If the Empire is paying attention, there must be something!
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
I wonder if I can go and investigate...?
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
Even though we're at war I don't think this is insane.
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Why is there a scholar like you on Nameless?
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
Because you picked a fight with the Landgriz family... I guess.
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
Hey, it's another big fight, isn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
That's nonsense... That's why I'm sending you a nameless message.
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
For No. 56 who says it's nonsense, I have one prediction for you.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Prophecy?
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
You'll thank me someday.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Hmm...I don't understand what that means.
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Imuka I wonder if it's okay?
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
no time
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
I'd like to ask you a little bit about the Calamity of Darcus.
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
...Imuka, are you listening?
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
Do you think the Dalax disaster was really caused by the Dalxians?
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
Not interested
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
Wow, that's tough.
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
Darcus people are not the subject of study.
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
Even if I get a backlash, I won't stop investigating.
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
My mission is to explore true history.
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Why don't you just read a book instead of chasing around the Darxians?
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
However, because I read the book I ended up being sent nameless .
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
In a book...?
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
I was arrested when I entered the library at Landgriz Castle without permission.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
That place is a treasure trove for historians.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Only people from the Landgriz family and the administrator in charge can enter.
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
Even though you're a university assistant professor... You didn't think you'd be
arrested ?
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
The history that is passed down is always the history of the victors.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
To know the true history, we need the history of the losers who are buried in
its shadow.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Excavating it is dangerous... Be prepared for the risk.
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
I don't really understand what smart people think.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
I, you guys...  Hurt the Darxians  I have no intention of doing so.
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Even if you don't feel like it we...
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
I believe if the true history is unraveled
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
Your future will change.
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
...no change, nothing
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
I'll change it, I'm sure
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
It's hot...
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Marching in this situation?  It's irresistible...
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Hurry up, everyone!  Let's hurry!
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
Why is No. 12 like that?  I'm fine...
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
The ruins are calling me
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
There are no Imperial troops anywhere, so we're done with it, right?
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
Not yet I can't go back until I understand the Imperial Army's purpose.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
We must at least investigate the size of the enemy force.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
At times like this it's unbearable when the captain is serious ...!
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
Captain
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Valerie?  What?
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
I would like to investigate the ruins of the Darcusian residence. Can I ask for
permission?
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
For what?
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
I would like to find out why the Imperial Army is coming to this ruins.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Even after the mission is over It doesn't matter Even if I'm alone...
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Dismiss It's a deviation from the mission 
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Of course there's a chance of encountering an enemy.
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
So what do you want to know?
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
We may learn something more important than just the Imperial Army's objectives.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
At least for an hour...
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
...I don't have time to waste time talking.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
That's how you say it...!
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
It's the Imperial Army...no doubt.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Huh!?
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Everyone, prepare for battle!
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
Very busy!
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Did that unit discover anything?
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
What are you doing Valerie?  Get ready!
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Oh, ah... yes!
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Valerie awakened
@fcFF008800 ``Door to History'' @fci instead of 
@fcFF008800 ``Intellectual Curiosity'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
The battle is over Don't let your guard down around you.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
It would be nice if it were just these guys.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Captain, I have a favor to ask of you.
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
What?
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
Please let me investigate the enemy's supplies.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
Find out what the enemy has retrieved from the ruins and you'll know what
they're trying to accomplish!
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
Understood, allow.
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Thank you!
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
I had no idea that the Imperial Army was carrying out such a full-scale
excavation survey.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
A lot of excavated items... This seems like a big new discovery.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
Most of the artifacts have characteristics different from the Darcian style.
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Rather, he is said to be a descendant of the Valkyrians.
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
Similar to ancient art handed down in the Landgrise family
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
I wonder what this means...?
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
There are clues to hidden history here.
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Was it something of value?
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
It's more than that.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
I can't say for sure unless I go back to university and look at the materials.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
There seems to be an important secret hidden in the history of the Darxians.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
If it is completely solved, history will be reversed... That's even possible.
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
That may improve the status of the Dalxians.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
...hah  You're sweet, scholar-sensei.
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
What's sweet?
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
The Darcus people because of the disaster of Darcus.  I'm not being persecuted.
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
This world needs victims Victims like us.
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
It is impossible for truth or history to change the current world.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
But if the truth... If the correct history is revealed people's eyes will
definitely be opened.
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
I'm sure the Dalxian's state of mind will change.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Don't say things from above I don't like that 
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
...I'm sorry
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
...But I don't think what you're trying to do is wrong.
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
The important thing is how you use the truth after you discover it, right?
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
So, scholar-sensei  Do it well I beg you.
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
...I understand.
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
It is too early to ask the world about this discovery now.
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
First of all, we have to create an era where that can be done.
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
For that reason, I will end the war I will leave Nameless and return to the
world of academia...
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
And someday, I'll be able to research freely... I'll definitely do it this way!
--------------------------------
