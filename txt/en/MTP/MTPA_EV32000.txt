[00000001][none]
Defeated the elite forces of the Imperial Army, by ourselves...?
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
I understand what you're trying to say.
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
The other person is at fault, right?  But it has been officially decided.
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
I'm sorry, but we have no choice but to do what's been decided.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
Does the command center not even know the difference between what is possible
and what is not possible?
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
Well, calm down Even I understand the seriousness of this situation.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
What's wrong?  It seems like your attitude is different today than usual.
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
...Someone in the upper echelons is provoking saying that the intelligence
department is useless. 
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
Sales words and buying words... You get it, right?
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
The job of intelligence is not to attack enemy forces on the battlefield, right?
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
I said I would do it!  It can't be helped!
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
I'm in trouble, at all...
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
The problem is this one...
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
Hello, Frederica-chan How are you doing?
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
Hehehe, Julio Make me something delicious again 
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
Of course.
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
If you can impress me then you can expect something in return.
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
A man like me deserves to impress a woman like you.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Oh Alphonse You're as cute as ever Your skin looks soft.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
If you're okay with me, you can spoil me anytime.
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
Is it okay to be spoiled?  In that case, I'd like to talk to you alone.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Would you like to go to a hill where you can see the sunset?
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
Geha!! Suddenly from behind!?
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
You don't have the courage to disturb the morale of the squad right in front of
me.
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
Looks like you're really hungry for education!
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
Oh, sweet So sweet that you can play it.
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
...I'm sorry, but I guess we'll have to talk about it another time.
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
At that time, please please give me all kinds of information hehe
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
No information...
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Looks like you're working with the same hands you used when I was younger.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
Oh, Gloria, were you there?
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
I was next to you the whole time.
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Or do you just not see women?
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
I'm sorry I like men.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
A man can tell me anything.
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
That's why I love it
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
Looks like he's quite a songwriter.
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
Why is a woman as skilled as you in a place like this?
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Did you make some terrible mistake?
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
...That's why I don't like women I'm a listener, not an answerer.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
But I'll give you one answer.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
I came here hoping
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
Gloria I'm bored, so could you talk to me ?
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
...Hmm, aren't you bad at women?
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
Hehehe, I'm not good with women, but I kind of like you.
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Because they smell the same
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
That's a great disgrace.
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Well, don't say that. Let's have a nice chat.
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
I'll tell you a special interesting story.
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
Oh, I'm looking forward to that.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Do you know why Maximilian is a 'quasi' crown prince ?
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
He is the emperor's biological son.
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Because her mother's status was low, she was excluded from being the legitimate
successor.
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
He hates the Empire There must be some big intention behind invading Gaul.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
I thought he wasn't just a warmonger, but I wonder if he has some personal
grudge involved.
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
His mother is said to have died in an accident, but apparently she was murdered.
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
I'm sure you're thinking of revenge.
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Who told you that?
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Imperial boss
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
I used to tell such dangerous stories to women!
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
I won't tell anyone, so it's okay.
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
Unless it makes money...
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
Then why did you tell me?
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
I thought it would open up customer routes. You have connections, right?
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
I thought that was the case anyway.
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
There are many other things too.
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
What about the Federation?
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
What, do you even know about the Federation?
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
My range of action is wide.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
That's a big deal, but I'd like to hear about Gaul.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
Then, what about General Damon's daughter ?
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
Oh, what's the story?
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
General Damon's daughter Actually...
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Frederica Can I have a moment?
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
Oh...
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
Commander Crow wants to see you. Could you come?
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
Okay, I'll go right away.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Gloria, I'm sorry but we'll talk about this another time.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Let me ask you one last thing 
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
You said you came here because you wanted to, but how did you sneak in?
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
That's easy This is the Punisher's unit.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
I just tried to create a scandal using my work partner.
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
You're thorough. It's easy to understand, you.
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
I brought Commander Crow No.19.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
Hello, Commander Crow.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
Thank you for your hard work â„–7, you can stand back.
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
Ha!
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
You look fine Frederica
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Hehehe... Maybe I should have called him ``Ramsay'' in front of him.
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
It's a bad joke
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
So, for what purpose did you call me?
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
...the one who pays the money
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
Oh, that's boring.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
Things are getting a little bad. I want to buy information on the Imperial Army.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
Hmm... So, what kind of person is he?
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
The 14th Armored Division of the Imperial Army... It is said to be one of the
most elite units in the Imperial Army.
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
...14th Armored Unit.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
It's not a famous unit I'm sure there was an officer who spoke proudly of it.
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
All you have to do is figure out how to outsmart them and win, right?
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Can you do it!?
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
All I can give you is information about the enemy.
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Think for yourself how to win.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
That's enough Please, tell me.
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
Yeah...
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
How much can I spend?
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Isn't it just the salaries paid to the members?
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
It's not the price negotiation that makes the other person angry, right?
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
I think I should tell the Captain about our relationship.
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
Got it!  Buy at the asking price!  That's fine.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
Hehehe, thank you for your purchase I love you, Ramsay.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
...Well, I just didn't want to use this move.
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
If you use this material, you can win.
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
14th Armored Corps battle record...?
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Where is this?
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
The intelligence department has its own way of fighting 
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
As you can see from the records, this unit has a regular movement .
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
It's obvious that the right wing is biased. The order of actions and military
results are concentrated on the right wing.
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
If you want to aim, start from the left wing. Lure the right wing into terrain
where it is difficult to move and fight.
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
Yes, ...but can you trust this material ?
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Of course It's raw information from the Imperial Army.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Sigh...
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
How much do you think I'll pay!
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
If it's fake, it won't be funny!
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
Frederica has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 "Informant" @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
... won
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
Kurt, you were even more brilliant this time.
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
...No, It's just that Commander Crow's advice was accurate.
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
So unnatural...
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Ufufu My information is also quite useful. 
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
Frederica What does that mean?
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
I spoke with Commander Crow before the battle. Does this have something to do
with it?
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
That's not me, ask Commander Crow.
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
This saved face Ramsay.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
Ah, that's helpful.
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Please pay to the same account.
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
...By the way I learned a little bit about you from this incident 
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
How?
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
I can't believe you...
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
That's it, Ramsay.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
Is Nameless's personal information confidential?
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
If you say that, wouldn't it be bad in a lot of ways?
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Uh...
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
This is the world We need to help each other.
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
Just don't do anything that would bring down Nameless.
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Don't worry
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
No matter how much I do, I would never do something that would hurt a friend. 
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
This will be my home for a while.
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
Hehehe... Danger, danger
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
If I get kicked out of here, there will be nothing left to protect me...
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
My espionage activity in another country was about to be discovered, so I took
refuge there.
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
That's what it is here
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
...Well, I'm sure I can survive here for the time being.
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
Frederica-chan I've made a new dish. Would you like to try it?
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
Of course, I'll go now.
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
Thank you for your continued support Everyone
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
Absolutely... Women are really scary creatures...
--------------------------------
