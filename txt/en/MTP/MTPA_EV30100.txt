--------------------------------
[00000001][none]
Everyone, it's food!
--------------------------------
[00000002][none]
Huh? What is that?
--------------------------------
[00000003][none]
It looks like a fish dish, but it's not military rations, right?
--------------------------------
[00000004][none]
I was able to get some good ingredients nearby today, so this is my special
menu.
--------------------------------
[00000005][none]
It's sauteed ``Fujifish''. This is a river fish, but it doesn't have a muddy
smell.
--------------------------------
[00000006][none]
The plain white meat is seasoned with consomme and grilled with herbs, making it
exquisite.
--------------------------------
[00000007][none]
Wow, what a nice scent!  It looks really delicious!
--------------------------------
[00000008][none]
Oh, it tastes great too!  Julio You made it!?
--------------------------------
[00000009][none]
Especially this season You can catch big fish. It's worth eating, isn't it?
--------------------------------
[00000010][none]
Eat more and more!  There's also refills!
--------------------------------
[00000011][none]
I never thought I'd be able to eat something this delicious while on a mission.
--------------------------------
[00000012][none]
But when did you go catch this fish?
--------------------------------
[00000013][none]
Actually, I slipped out of camp for a little while at night and went to the
river.
--------------------------------
[00000014][none]
It would be difficult if the captain found out!?
--------------------------------
[00000015][none]
I really wanted to feed everyone this season's Fujio fish!
--------------------------------
[00000016][none]
If that's the case, I'm prepared to take some risk.
--------------------------------
[00000017][none]
Why are you so desperate to cook?
--------------------------------
[00000018][none]
My day job is a chef I'm better at cooking than shooting guns.
--------------------------------
[00000019][none]
Even if you have a real job... It's probably too much.
--------------------------------
[00000020][none]
Did you work at some famous shop?
--------------------------------
[00000021][none]
No, I wanted to learn about various cuisines, so I traveled all over Gaul to
train.
--------------------------------
[00000022][none]
Someday, I would like to travel around the world  and research flavors 
--------------------------------
[00000023][none]
It's impossible without peace.
--------------------------------
[00000024][none]
Well
--------------------------------
[00000025][none]
Huh?
--------------------------------
[00000026][none]
What's wrong Amy?
--------------------------------
[00000027][none]
It's a different and delicious dish than usual.
--------------------------------
[00000028][none]
I wonder if No. 56 doesn't eat it.
--------------------------------
[00000029][none]
№56...?
--------------------------------
[00000030][none]
Look, I'm just sitting over there without eating anything.
--------------------------------
[00000031][none]
It can't be helped Hey, No. 56!
--------------------------------
[00000032][none]
…………
--------------------------------
[00000033][none]
Don't be sullen Let's enjoy the meal!
--------------------------------
[00000034][none]
Come on, try it!  This is my work of confidence.
--------------------------------
[00000035][none]
Please leave me alone 
--------------------------------
[00000036][none]
Well, don't say that. Try a bite!
--------------------------------
[00000037][none]
I'm confident in the taste Everyone says it's delicious !
--------------------------------
[00000038][none]
...just one bite.
--------------------------------
[00000039][none]
Oh, it doesn't matter.
--------------------------------
[00000040][none]
...I ate This is fine.
--------------------------------
[00000041][none]
After all, food is food Nothing more, nothing less.
--------------------------------
[00000042][none]
Hmm... Maybe it didn't suit your tastes 
--------------------------------
[00000043][none]
...What are you laughing at?
--------------------------------
[00000044][none]
I know a little bit about your taste preferences 
--------------------------------
[00000045][none]
Taste is different for each person.
--------------------------------
[00000046][none]
Knowing that is very important for a chef.
--------------------------------
[00000047][none]
...that's rubbish
--------------------------------
[00000048][none]
Hey, can I have a moment?
--------------------------------
[00000049][none]
What is it for?
--------------------------------
[00000050][none]
I accidentally forgot to ask you what you thought about the dish you cooked the
other day.
--------------------------------
[00000051][none]
Could you tell me how the sauteed ``Fujiuo'' tasted ?
--------------------------------
[00000052][none]
That's a hassle...
--------------------------------
[00000053][none]
Please don't say that It's important to me 
--------------------------------
[00000054][none]
I don't know anything about taste.
--------------------------------
[00000055][none]
Anything is fine Say what you feel.
--------------------------------
[00000056][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000057][none]
I would like it to be a little less salty. The taste of my hometown where I grew
up was more gentle.
--------------------------------
[00000058][none]
Kind, huh? That's very interesting.
--------------------------------
[00000059][none]
Does Darcus cuisine contain less salt overall?
--------------------------------
[00000060][none]
Do you have any complaints about the food of the Dalxians?
--------------------------------
[00000061][none]
There's nothing to complain about!  I just want to know your taste preferences
and cooking 
--------------------------------
[00000062][none]
I dedicate my life to cooking.
--------------------------------
[00000063][none]
Why is there someone who spends his life cooking on Nameless...
--------------------------------
[00000064][none]
Come to think of it, didn't I tell you why I came to Nameless?
--------------------------------
[00000065][none]
Do you know the food called black diamond?
--------------------------------
[00000066][none]
What, all of a sudden... I've heard of it It's a high-class ingredient, right?
--------------------------------
[00000067][none]
That's right!  Black diamonds are narwhal shark eggs.
--------------------------------
[00000068][none]
Since ancient times, it has been valued as a nourishing tonic and a food that
cures all kinds of illnesses...
--------------------------------
[00000069][none]
The price of narwhal sharks has skyrocketed due to a drastic drop in catches of
narwhal sharks.
--------------------------------
[00000070][none]
Nowadays, it is such a valuable and high-class ingredient that it is said to be
a mythical ingredient.
--------------------------------
[00000071][none]
I heard that such a phantom ingredient is among the special ingredients reserved
for officers.
--------------------------------
[00000072][none]
Maybe...
--------------------------------
[00000073][none]
Oh!  I snuck into the storage room and took it.
--------------------------------
[00000074][none]
Even though they don't give much food to ordinary soldiers.
--------------------------------
[00000075][none]
It's not fair that only officers are eating good food.
--------------------------------
[00000076][none]
And if you hear about the phantom ingredients and don't do anything, you've
failed as a chef.
--------------------------------
[00000077][none]
As illusory as it is, it was actually a worthwhile ingredient to cook with.
--------------------------------
[00000078][none]
Sauteed and salad... The fries were good, too. I served it to everyone in the
squad.
--------------------------------
[00000079][none]
Is that why you were sent here ?  You're an idiot...
--------------------------------
[00000080][none]
Haha, maybe so. But I don't regret it.
--------------------------------
[00000081][none]
My friends looked amazing when they ate the food I made.
--------------------------------
[00000082][none]
...huh
--------------------------------
[00000083][none]
Oops I told you a boring story 
--------------------------------
[00000084][none]
Now that I think about it... Darkus' home cooking.
--------------------------------
[00000085][none]
There was something that used ``Kohakudake''.
--------------------------------
[00000086][none]
If it's "Kohakudake"...!?
--------------------------------
[00000087][none]
The ``Kohakudake'' soup was really delicious!  I want to make it too
--------------------------------
[00000088][none]
……
--------------------------------
[00000089][none]
Sorry to keep you talking so long!  See you then!
--------------------------------
[00000090][none]
How does he know about ``Kohakudake''?
--------------------------------
[00000091][none]
Only the Dalxians would eat that...
--------------------------------
[00000092][none]
Where did you get that knowledge...?
--------------------------------
[00000093][none]
From now on, Nameless will begin a joint operation with the regular army to
liberate Zoff Village.
--------------------------------
[00000094][none]
This is close to the border with the Empire. There are a lot of enemy forces
defending themselves.
--------------------------------
[00000095][none]
It's a strategy to collaborate with the regular army, but don't let your guard
down. That's good.
--------------------------------
[00000096][none]
Okay!  Win exactly Let's have a celebration party.
--------------------------------
[00000097][none]
That's right.
--------------------------------
[00000098][none]
Darcus Village... Maybe you can get it! 
--------------------------------
[00000099][none]
I can't do it I don't care what happened to the Dalxian village 
--------------------------------
[00000100][none]
Why do we in the regular army have to do this kind of mission?
--------------------------------
[00000101][none]
A punishment squad called Nameless is coming, right?
--------------------------------
[00000102][none]
Just let them do it. It's no joke.
--------------------------------
[00000103][none]
The regular army's movement is slow I expected it, but it's a problem.
--------------------------------
[00000104][none]
You have zero motivation. What is the captain doing ?
--------------------------------
[00000105][none]
The captain isn't motivated, either. It's time to start the operation, but
there's no sign of him moving.
--------------------------------
[00000106][none]
Kurt! If this happens Let's take the lead!  If I wait, it will be night.
--------------------------------
[00000107][none]
What's wrong, Julio?  I thought you weren't keen on fighting but...
--------------------------------
[00000108][none]
Sometimes even I feel motivated!
--------------------------------
[00000109][none]
I would like to share Julio's motivation with the regular army.
--------------------------------
[00000110][none]
It has to do with cooking, anyway.
--------------------------------
[00000111][none]
Any reason is fine!  Kurt, let's get started!
--------------------------------
[00000112][none]
Indeed, if things continue like this, it won't be clear the operation has begun!
--------------------------------
[00000113][none]
Julio has awakened to the potential @fcFF008800 ``Cook's Guide'' @fci.
--------------------------------
[00000114][none]
Well, it's finally over.
--------------------------------
[00000115][none]
The regular army went out of its way to come to our rescue. Thank you, Darxians!
--------------------------------
[00000116][none]
Those people did almost nothing...
--------------------------------
[00000117][none]
Not at all...
--------------------------------
[00000118][none]
Thank you for coming this far 
--------------------------------
[00000119][none]
Please allow me to offer you some small hospitality.
--------------------------------
[00000120][none]
Hospitality?  Ha, I'm not kidding.
--------------------------------
[00000121][none]
Even if I'm hungry, I don't want to eat Dalxian food 
--------------------------------
[00000122][none]
I guess you're eating something strange!
--------------------------------
[00000123][none]
Wouldn't it be nice to be treated like garbage?  Haha!
--------------------------------
[00000124][none]
...Hey, you guys apologize to this woman.
--------------------------------
[00000125][none]
What are you?  Don't let the nameless Darxian  get in your way!
--------------------------------
[00000126][none]
Come on, No. 6 There's nothing good about going against the regular army 
--------------------------------
[00000127][none]
I'm sorry, but I can't stay silent No matter who the other person is, I can't
tolerate what you said just now!
--------------------------------
[00000128][none]
What's the point if I can't forgive you?  Nameless fuzei!
--------------------------------
[00000129][none]
Yes, yes!  Even Nameless Fuzei can do this!
--------------------------------
[00000130][none]
Huh...?
--------------------------------
[00000131][none]
Now it's time for food!  Everyone there Please gather at the cafeteria!
--------------------------------
[00000132][none]
What the hell!?
--------------------------------
[00000133][none]
Julio, I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood for food right now.
--------------------------------
[00000134][none]
What are you talking about? You were fighting over food, weren't you?
--------------------------------
[00000135][none]
Those regular army guys!  You're hungry. Eat my cooking.
--------------------------------
[00000136][none]
Why do we have to eat your cooking?
--------------------------------
[00000137][none]
I guarantee the taste. If you don't like it, I'll give you my grandmother's
treasured sake as a souvenir.
--------------------------------
[00000138][none]
Hey!  Don't take other people's things your way !
--------------------------------
[00000139][none]
Hmm, if you can get some alcohol, you can go and do it.
--------------------------------
[00000140][none]
Come on, enjoy!
--------------------------------
[00000141][none]
What is this!? It's just soup!
--------------------------------
[00000142][none]
Just try the soup!  That's the story!
--------------------------------
[00000143][none]
Such a simple soup... Hmm?
--------------------------------
[00000144][none]
This guy...
--------------------------------
[00000145][none]
Wow, the regular army guys got stiff!?
--------------------------------
[00000146][none]
Well, everyone, enjoy it while it's hot!
--------------------------------
[00000147][none]
Wow, it's delicious!  It has a strange taste that I have never tasted before!
--------------------------------
[00000148][none]
I see... this place was the production area for ``Kohakudake''.
--------------------------------
[00000149][none]
Kohakudake?
--------------------------------
[00000150][none]
This is a rare type of mushroom used only by the Dalxians for food.
--------------------------------
[00000151][none]
Special techniques are required to remove the scum and odor, but it brings out a
nice flavor.
--------------------------------
[00000152][none]
Darcus...?  Is this something the Dalxians are preying on?
--------------------------------
[00000153][none]
Dalxians are good at bringing out the flavor of the ingredients.
--------------------------------
[00000154][none]
I often use it as a reference as well.
--------------------------------
[00000155][none]
Pass the plates around. Next time, I'll serve you risotto using this soup.
--------------------------------
[00000156][none]
...It smells so good I never thought you could eat something like this on the
battlefield 
--------------------------------
[00000157][none]
Um... this is fried amber mushroom I hope it suits your taste.
--------------------------------
[00000158][none]
...Hmm, not bad.
--------------------------------
[00000159][none]
I had no idea there was such food...
--------------------------------
[00000160][none]
What do you think? It's good, right?  If you narrow your perspective with
prejudice, you will miss out on the good things.
--------------------------------
[00000161][none]
...hey Do you have any refills?
--------------------------------
[00000162][none]
...me too These fries are good.
--------------------------------
[00000163][none]
Yes!  Please wait a moment!
--------------------------------
[00000164][none]
...No.32, I think I'll have to reevaluate you a little.
--------------------------------
[00000165][none]
Haha!  It's not me who's reconsidering It's ``Kohakudake.''
--------------------------------
[00000166][none]
Whew... I wonder how long it's been since I had such a delicious meal 
--------------------------------
[00000167][none]
Ah, I feel so satisfied ...
--------------------------------
[00000168][none]
Please give your thanks to the villagers. The ingredients and cooking methods
are all obtained here. 
--------------------------------
[00000169][none]
...It was delicious If you come here again Please let me eat it.
--------------------------------
[00000170][none]
Yes!  Thank you!
--------------------------------
[00000171][none]
You guys look great!  I want to see your face like that I'm cooking.
--------------------------------
[00000172][none]
Hehe, it looks like it's all settled down 
--------------------------------
[00000173][none]
Well... Looks like the chef is the only winner 
--------------------------------
[00000174][none]
...Ah
--------------------------------
[00000175][none]
Cooking has the power to bring smiles all over the world.
--------------------------------
[00000176][none]
Food is mightier than the sword!  What!
--------------------------------
