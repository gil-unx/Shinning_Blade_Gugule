[00000164]
Graduated from the Royal Military Academy of Ranshir at the top of his class. 
He is a perfectionist and is quite picky. He was a second lieutenant in the
Gallian regular army who had a promising future, but after a certain incident he
fell into namelessness.
--------------------------------
[00000165]
Although he struggled to bring together the unique Nameless, he gradually gained
the trust of his members, and eventually grew into a powerful unit that was able
to take down a mountain fortress that was said to be impregnable.
--------------------------------
[00000166]
Afterwards, in the w
--------------------------------
[00000167]
Although he is often misunderstood, he is by no means a self-centered person.
Because I was so different from other people, I didn't know how to be
considerate.  It's just the type of person that is extremely difficult to
understand.
--------------------------------
[00000168]
After the armistice, he abandoned his name and
--------------------------------
[00000169]
She has a bright and positive personality and is a caring person. He is a
physical person who grew up in the countryside and is not good at academics.  I
don't have any likes or dislikes, but rather I have a picky taste  I have a
special skill (?) that makes whatever I eat taste delicious.
--------------------------------
[00000170]
He meets Dr. Forster and learns that he is a Valkyrian. However, the doctor
points out that he is a defective person who cannot fully use his powers.
--------------------------------
[00000171]
It is said that a Valkyrie's power awakens when her life is in danger. By
perceiving the danger faced by all her Nameless members, including herself,
Riera was able to awaken her strong will to control her power.
--------------------------------
[00000172]
Since he was a child, he was not liked by others, but he was loved by the
elderly couple who raised him. Her memory is the source of her devoted
personality and her kindness.
--------------------------------
[00000173]
After the final battle, he and Kurt hide out in a small town in Federation
territory. She got engaged soon after and she started calling herself Riella
Irving, but it took several years for her to build up a living and get married.
--------------------------------
[00000174]
He is silent and almost never speaks to me. He has no interest in anything other
than combat and the exotic weapons he possesses, and is devoted to combat
training. He is also indifferent to the fact that he is a Darcusian.
--------------------------------
[00000175]
He grew up in a small Dalxian village called Tilka Village within the Empire's
territory, but the village was burned to the ground in an instant by a demon
clad in blue flames, and from then on he began to live for revenge.
--------------------------------
[00000176]
After Selvaria passed away, he lost the meaning of life. However, he accepts the
wishes of Kurt, his unique benefactor, and seeks a new meaning in life.  With
this opportunity, she gradually returned to her true self.
--------------------------------
[00000177]
The reason he sought power was for revenge.  That power is not strength, but
rather a means to surely stop the enemy's death,  and it is not something that
should be competed with others.
--------------------------------
[00000178]
The fact that he killed someone with his own hands and caused sadness.  To
shoulder this burden and at least make amends, After Nameless was disbanded, he
decided to open an orphanage.  When Kurt heard about his new purpose, he was
very happy.
--------------------------------
[00000179]
A Darcus person who is friendly and caring, and who is like a big brother you
can rely on. Not only is he strong with machines and can skillfully operate a
tank, but he is also highly educated.
--------------------------------
[00000180]
He was forced to abandon the Darcus refugees under the orders of the regular
army, and he developed strong anger and distrust towards the Gallic army. 
That's a big knot in his chest.
--------------------------------
[00000181]
He was born into a prominent Darxian family, and was trained in swordsmanship
when he was young. Although he is a tank driver, he is actually better at
hand-to-hand combat.
--------------------------------
[00000182]

--------------------------------
[00000183]

--------------------------------
[00000184]
With his cheerful and friendly personality, he can get along with anyone. 
However, when he sees a girl, he can't help but call out to him, and sometimes
he comes off as an easy-going guy.
--------------------------------
[00000185]
It was discovered that he was using ingredients stockpiled at a military
facility without permission, and he was transferred to Nameless. \ nCurrently,
he spends his days researching dishes using local specialties\ n that he has
obtained from various places.
--------------------------------
[00000186]
His motto is "Cooking makes people happy." He believes that cooking has the
power to bridge different cultures, including religion, race, and nationality. 
That's his charm and the source of his cheerfulness.
--------------------------------
[00000187]
After the war, he traveled around the world as a kitchen sink chef, continuing
to explore flavors. Even in a foreign country, he quickly blends in with his
natural cheerfulness and woos a girl, but he can't seem to find her lover.
--------------------------------
[00000188]

--------------------------------
[00000189]
He has a strong sense of justice and a sincere personality, and is respected by
other members. He is a caring and dependable man, but he is insensitive to
women's feelings and often makes mistakes, so he is not well-received by the
opposite sex.
--------------------------------
[00000190]
During his time in the regular army, his abilities were highly evaluated, but
his advice to his superiors was judged to be rebellious, and he was transferred
to Nameless. He is the best in the unit when it comes to bravery.
--------------------------------
[00000191]
Since he lost his entire family in World War I, he has a strong yearning for his
family. He considers his soldiers to be his family and believes that by
protecting them, he can become stronger as well.
--------------------------------
[00000192]
After the war, he joined the military organizations and vigilante groups of
various countries as a mercenary and continued to fight against the Imperial
Army.  His personality and extensive experience earn him tremendous trust, but
he still makes many gaffes toward women, making him unpopular.
--------------------------------
[00000193]

--------------------------------
[00000194]
A gentleman whose trademarks include flowing blonde hair and a large belly. He
has a bright and cheerful personality and is attentive, making him an
indispensable mood maker.
--------------------------------
[00000195]
I try to be fair to everyone.  The way he speaks as if he is joking  is his own
unique way of speaking, which he developed to comment on others regardless of
their age or status.
--------------------------------
[00000196]
A former great detective who can uncover any villain with his outstanding
information gathering abilities and great deductions.  Abandon the
conspiracy-filled aristocratic society and correct this world.  That was the
path he chose.
--------------------------------
[00000197]
Naturally, he abandoned his noble family, and detective work is a secret job
that can be done in any country, so he doesn't have to worry about making a
living. However, it seems a shame that he cannot correct the wrongs of his
beloved homeland.
--------------------------------
[00000198]

--------------------------------
[00000199]
A twisted Darxian. He doesn't try to get along with those around him and insists
on calling other members by number.  I have a tendency to express my feelings in
words immediately.
--------------------------------
[00000200]
Because he is tall, stands out, and has a backward personality, he is easily
noticed. He has been used to being beaten since he was a boy, so he has become
tolerant of pain.
--------------------------------
[00000201]
The name of his only i
--------------------------------
[00000202]
After the war, he wandered around while earning a small income from his
specialty, wirework, visiting his fellow countrymen living in various countries.
As I came into contact with many Darxians, I developed a desire to know my
roots.
--------------------------------
[00000203]

--------------------------------
[00000204]
He looks slender and frail, but he is a former regular army soldier. He is calm
and friendly, but his words and actions lack ambition and give you no sense of
life. He is so overshadowed that sometimes you can forget about his existence.
--------------------------------
[00000205]
He is an oddball who volunteered to be assigned to Nameless, and despite his
appearance, he loves fighting. Since he first fought under Kurt's command, he
has recognized Kurt's military talent and respects him.
--------------------------------
[00000206]
He was in despa
--------------------------------
[00000207]
``I can't die without Kurt's orders.'' Even after Nameless was disbanded, he
looked up to Kurt as his captain, and while waiting for orders, he lived the
rest of his life peacefully with a shepherd on a plateau. .
--------------------------------
[00000208]

--------------------------------
[00000209]
He has a solid and caring personality. He can't leave people in trouble or bad
people alone. He is concerned about his short height, and claims that he is 150
cm tall when he says he is 1 cm tall.
--------------------------------
[00000210]
Her personality is similar to that of her mother, who ran away from her father
who didn't work when she was 10 years old.  Gloria says that ``if I were to
marry her, I would choose Amy,'' she is trying to emulate other female members.
--------------------------------
[00000211]
The fact that your feelings are transferred to someone who is clumsy and
unreciprocated proves that your love for your father is genuine.  It doesn't
suit a 15-year-old girl, but I guess that's just her personality.
--------------------------------
[00000212]
After the war, I tried to follow Daito, but I was left behind. \ nIn the end, he
got a decent job through Gloria's connections, but  he feels unsatisfied with
his ordinary life.
--------------------------------
[00000213]

--------------------------------
[00000214]
A beautiful woman with a queen-like temperament who has a strong desire to
dominate and feels joy in making others obey her. She has a strong personality
that is not influenced by others, and her reasons for transferring to Nameless
seem to be radical.
--------------------------------
[00000215]
Sh
--------------------------------
[00000216]
Her wish is for world peace, and she believes that if she educates all the bad
men in the world, starting with Maximilian, she can eliminate conflicts. In a
sense, she can be said to be the ultimate man lover.
--------------------------------
[00000217]
After the war, she goes on a journey to educate useless men for world peace. 
There are helpless men everywhere, and there is no shortage of people to
educate.  His occupation is a trainer.
--------------------------------
[00000218]

--------------------------------
[00000219]
A cheerful girl with high physical ability. She greedily seeks ``strength'' and
trains hard every day. She has a cheerful personality and is easily liked by
others, but she is also simple-minded and doesn't understand jokes.
--------------------------------
[00000220]
I believe that everything, including being sent to Nameless, is a path to
becoming stronger. His special skills are elbow strikes and low kicks.  I'm
currently in trouble because I don't have anyone to practice my ground skills
with.
--------------------------------
[00000221]
She understands the meaning of ``true strength'' almost instantly, and is indeed
the real thing.  Also, thanks to Gloria, her carrot cooking skills have improved
, and her training as a bride seems to be going well.
--------------------------------
[00000222]
After the war, he enthusiastically set out on a journey to train as a warrior
around the world, which he had been thinking about for some time.  He has sent a
letter to his master, Gloria, informing her of the results of his training, and
the relationship between master and student continues.
--------------------------------
[00000223]

--------------------------------
[00000224]
A female member who is 62 years old. She calls herself an old hag, and although
she doesn't mind being called an old hag, she gets angry when someone treats her
like an old person. According to herself, she is still active.
--------------------------------
[00000225]
Even now, she is so popular that she boasts that she has no problem with men. 
It must have been amazing when he was younger.  However, it seems that she will
never say whether she was happy or not.
--------------------------------
[00000226]
She is experienced and knows that Gaul cannot be saved just by using legitimate
positions and means.  ``A path is a path, there is no right or wrong.'' These
words probably tell us everything about her sense of values.
--------------------------------
[00000227]
Gloria, who live

[00000228]

--------------------------------
[00000230]
Even during the war, he never forgets to explore history.  The reason I was sent
to Nameless is because I took a risk to find out the truth.
--------------------------------
[00000231]
I decided to open a new page in Gaul's history using the clues I found in the
Barias Desert. For that reason, he will end this battle and solidify his will to
advance the era.
--------------------------------
[00000232]
After the war, he completely lost his research and position at the university,
but started over from scratch by relying on researchers he had close friendships
with from other countries.  Her passion will not be lost to her with such an
obstacle.
--------------------------------
[00000233]

--------------------------------
[00000234]
I spend most of the day drinking.  His comments are sloppy and random, but he's
so cheerful that you can't hate him.  Once you start talking about shit, you
might not be able to stop.
--------------------------------
[00000235]
A native of Filard Kingdom. After his homeland was destroyed in World War I, he
became a mercenary, and when the war began, he joined the Gallian Volunteer
Army, but he got into trouble with alcohol and was sent to Nameless.
--------------------------------
[00000236]
At the drinking party, I heard that he was a former general of Filard's army,
and that he had retired after giving up his position to Jaeger. I'm not sure if
it's true or false.  However, his desire to restore his homeland is genuine.

[00000395]
When Yuel City was attacked by the Imperial Army, he lost his parents right in
front of his eyes, and was traumatized by the red color of his blood, causing
him to suffer from color blindness. He still hasn't given up on his dream of
becoming a doctor.
--------------------------------
[00000396]
After the war, he continued to study medicine with the intention of becoming a
doctor, but due to financial reasons he gave up on going to medical school. He
studied medical technology at the Royal Military Academy of Lancille, which had
a special privilege system. It seems that he was also blessed with good friends.
--------------------------------
[00000397]

--------------------------------
[00000398]

--------------------------------
[00000399]
The daughter of the Eberhard family, a prestigious aristocratic family in Gaul.
She is currently studying at the Royal Military Academy of Lancille and has
decided that her future is to become a military officer. She is confident, but
she has excellent leadership skills.
--------------------------------
[00000400]
She experienced actual combat command in an unexpected situation. She promised
to reunite with Leon, a volunteer soldier who fought alongside her.  However, at
that time, the two had no way of knowing the ironic fate that would await them a
few years later. 
--------------------------------
[00000401]
After the war, he continued to study at the Royal Military Academy of Ranshir
and became the class president of Class A, which gathered the most talented
students. He takes the lead himself and pulls those around him with his will to
fight.
--------------------------------
[00000402]

--------------------------------
[00000403]

--------------------------------
[00000404]
Cardinal of Yggdism. He advocates a theory that is easy to understand for common
people, called the ``Valkyria Salvation Theory,'' and since World War I, he has
gained the support of common people who are tired of the war.
--------------------------------
[00000405]
Contrary to his outward appearance, he is trying to prolong the war by secretly
communicating with Major General Eisler of the Gallic Army.  He has a distorted
idea of ??continuing the war until all continental people rely on Valkyria's
salvation. 
--------------------------------
[00000406]
When he failed to kill Eisler and was expelled from the Yggdo Order, he was
protected by Dahau, but was killed after having ``Valkyria's Hammer'' stolen
from him. He remained a good man to the public until the end of his life.
--------------------------------
[00000407]

--------------------------------
[00000408]

--------------------------------
[00000409]
Captain of Calamity Raven. His rank is captain.  He has the skin of a genuine
hero who shows his composure in everything. He has an excellent long-term
strategic eye and does not play a losing battle. He is therefore called the man
who knows no defeat.
--------------------------------
[00000410]
He not only fights as an Imperial soldier, but also participates in this war
with the goal of fighting for the independence of the Darcus people. He often
seems to make decisions based on his own judgment.
--------------------------------
[00000411]
He worked out a deal in which Cardinal Borgia wanted to intervene in the war,
and in return he would be given the backing of independence in return for being
part of Cardinal Borgia's private army.  However, it does not support the
doctrine.
--------------------------------
[00000412]
Maximilian and Jaeger knew him to be dangerous, but considered him competent.
This is probably because he judged that he was a person who acted based on
reason, not emotion.
--------------------------------
[00000413]
Killed in action on October 15, 1935. \ nA vision from his wife admonished him
that independence through armed force, which he chose as a last resort, was not
the path he should take, and the hero of Darcus quietly passed away.
--------------------------------
[00000414]
Captain Dachau's adjutant, who belongs to Calamity Raven. He has a reputation
for being foul-mouthed.  She is not the only Darcian in this unit.  Her dark
skin is proof that she is not a true Imperial citizen.
--------------------------------
[00000415]
She is basically the type of person who doesn't trust other people, and suspects
that Gusrug, who has switched sides, is a spy.  To her, an individualist, her
ethnic beliefs and ideals only sound like  shady nonsense.
--------------------------------
[00000416]
However, at the Battle of Nazial, he learned of the Nameless' abilities and was
surprised that Gusurg was able to fight them with a small force.  Also, I'm a
little interested in him because of his toughness, among all the Darxians who
have no secrets.
--------------------------------
[00000417]
She was an orphan who was raised in a Yugdo cult facility. \ nThe surname Agute
was given to her later, and she hates the non-existent fictitious family name
from the bottom of her heart.
--------------------------------
[00000418]
Killed in action on October 10, 1935.  His short life ended before his
relationship with Gusrug progressed to the point where it could be called a
romance.  She seemed to think that they weren't a bad match.
--------------------------------
[00000419]
Belongs to Calamity Raven and serves as Lieutenant Lieutenant Lydia Agute's
assistant.  A Darxian who is obsessed with Dachau and runs away as a young man. 
For better or for worse, it's a straight line, and it's typical of a young man.
--------------------------------
[00000420]
I have no doubt that Calamity Raven is completely righteous as a Darxian.  His
assertiveness is just like that of a boy who knows no faults, His blue words
sometimes cut deep into the hearts of adults.
--------------------------------
[00000421]
When he was faced with the situation of ``Landgriz bombing'', he chose not to
follow the ideals of Gusrug, but to remain loyal to Dachau, which continued to
search for a realistic path to independence. It was to continue.
--------------------------------
[00000422]
He played Dachau
--------------------------------
[00000423]
Killed in action on October 15, 1935. Undeterred and unafraid, he continued to
block the Nameless's advance, until he finally ran out of steam.  He was loyal
to Dachau until the end.
--------------------------------
[00000424]
A Darcus person who is friendly and caring, and who is like a big brother you
can rely on. Not only is he strong with machines and can skillfully operate a
tank, but he is also highly educated.
--------------------------------
[00000425]
He was forced to abandon the Darcus refugees under the orders of the regular
army, and he developed strong anger and distrust towards the Gallic army. 
That's a big knot in his chest.
--------------------------------
[00000426]
He was born into a prestigious family as a Darxian, and was trained in
swordsmanship when he was young. Although he is a tank driver, he is actually
better at hand-to-hand combat.
--------------------------------
[00000427]
After deserting from the Gallic army, he joined Calamity Raven. He believes that
the "independence of the Darcians" advocated by Dachau is the ideal he seeks,
and sets out on a new path.
--------------------------------
[00000428]
Killed in action on October 10, 1935. Although he was defeated in the decisive
battle with Kurt, he lived his life devoted to his ideals and ended his life
with no regrets.
--------------------------------
[00000429]
Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Army's invasion force in Gallia.  He is a
semi-crown prince of the empire and is highly praised as a rare hero.  He values
??talented people regardless of their status. He is a complete believer in the
supremacy of ability.
--------------------------------
[00000430]
His target was the ancient weapon ``Valkyria's Sacred Spear'' hidden in Landgriz
Castle. He planned to equip the giant land battleship Marmot with this to take
revenge on the Empire for killing his mother.
--------------------------------
[00000431]
Killed in action on October 10, 1935. He moved the Marmots from Landgriz to
intercept the Gallic volunteer army that had defeated the Jaegers.  As a result,
this arrogance turned out to be fatal.
--------------------------------
[00000432]

--------------------------------
[00000433]

--------------------------------
[00000434]
A commander directly under Crown Prince Maximilian One of the ``Drei Stern''. He
has an almost adoring love for Maximilian and pledges his allegiance to him.
--------------------------------
[00000435]
In order to protect Maximilian from the Nameless who raided Ghirlandaio
Fortress, he unleashes the power of Valkyria.  His power was overwhelming.
--------------------------------
[00000436]
Died on October 8, 1935.  She failed to defend Ghirlandaio Fortress and was
taken prisoner. She ignited the last flame of Valkyria, and died in an explosion
along with the Gallic army that had gathered at the fortress.
--------------------------------
[00000437]

--------------------------------
[00000438]

--------------------------------
[00000439]
A commander directly under Crown Prince Maximilian One of the ``Drei Stern''. He
is a veteran military commander with a chivalrous spirit that shows respect even
to his enemies, and a calm judgment.
--------------------------------
[00000440]
While preparing to depart from Fortress Ghirlandaio, they were attacked by
Nameless and had to evacuate.  If the damage at that time hadn't delayed the
sortie, the Imperial Army might have broken through the Central Front.
--------------------------------
[00000441]
After being defeated by Second Lieutenant Welkin Gunther's forces in the battle
for the city of Basel, he never returned to Maximilian and disappeared.  No one
knows what happened after that.
--------------------------------
[00000442]

--------------------------------
[00000443]

--------------------------------
[00000444]
A commander directly under Crown Prince Maximilian One of the "Drei Sterns". He
comes from an earl family with deep ties to the imperial family.  His hobby is
chess, and his skill is on par with Jaeger.
--------------------------------
[00000445]
He pledges allegiance to the Emperor as a unique being, and dedicates himself to
the unification of the continent by the Empire.  It prefers strategies that
overwhelm the enemy with an overwhelming difference in strength by concentrating
its forces.
--------------------------------
[00000446]
Killed in action on August 5, 1935. \ nAt Fausen, the 3rd Company of the Gallic
Volunteer Force\ n dropped the armored train Ezel he was riding into a ravine,
ending his life.
--------------------------------
[00000447]

--------------------------------
[00000448]

--------------------------------
[00000449]
Imperial Valkyria researcher. He conducted numerous human experiments at the
Valkyria Research Facility, and as a result he awakened Selvaria. He is a
ruthless human being who has no sense of right and wrong or ethics.
--------------------------------
[00000450]
They discover a new research material called Riera, but when it turns out to be
a defective material, their interest wanes a little. \ nHowever, he leaves his
spear and shield behind in Riera in order to obtain data from the battle between
the Valkyries.
--------------------------------
[00000451]
Maximilian, a supporter of the Valkyria Research Facility, died, so he fled to
Gaul.  At that time, it has been confirmed that he was accompanied by a
Valkyrian child.

An important resource that supports human civilization and is used throughout
the continent as an energy resource.  It has been confirmed that ragnite ore has
existed on the continent since ancient times.  Ragnite is excavated as an
energy-containing ore. By refining it, it can be used as a resource for various
purposes.  For this reason, it is used all over the continent,  becoming an
important resource that supports human civilization.  A major feature is that it
emits blue light when energy is released. # #It is said that ragnite technology
has advanced dramatically since the ancient Valkyrians spread the technology of
ragnite refining.  After the technological innovations brought about by the
Industrial Revolution, ragnite became an inseparable resource inseparable from
people's lives.  However, since it is also a fuel for weapons such as tanks and
military vehicles, ragnite has gone from being a resource that supports people's
lives to being a strategic resource. In order to secure it, each country on the
continent is eager to expand its territory. became.

In the event of an emergency, all citizens can be subject to conscription, which
is the system of universal conscription.  It was established after the Gallic
War of Independence to maintain the national policy of ``armed neutrality.''  In
the event of an emergency, the security maintenance organization in each local
government is organized as a volunteer army under the regular army. The soldiers
below the platoon commander are made up of volunteers and conscripted citizens.
However, depending on the war situation, A three-stage mobilization system will
be adopted.  It is a citizen's duty and cannot be refused unless there is a
special reason. # #In the Principality of Gaul, military training is required as
a compulsory credit subject from elementary school to university.  In
particular, since elementary school to junior high school is compulsory
education, all citizens have learned the basics of combat.  The university also
provides training and education for officers, and the university also serves as
a military academy.  Those who complete the officer training course are called
up as second lieutenants and must serve as commanding officers.

A huge drawbridge spanning the Basel River.  It was built in the late Middle
Ages as a key point for the defense of the capital, Landgriz.  It was originally
a single bridge, but extensive renovation work was carried out in the 19th
century, and a unique bellows-type opening and closing mechanism was introduced
to the Basel Bridge.  The Vasel River, which flows into Lake Graz on the banks
of Landgriz Castle,  connects directly to the throat of the capital Landgriz. 
Large, sturdy towers have been erected on both banks of the bridge, and guards
are stationed day and night , keeping watch and guarding the bridge 24 hours a
day. # #The city of Basel, which stretches across the Basel Bridge, is connected
to the North Sea through a canal, and has been an important transportation hub
connecting continental cities and Landgris since ancient times.  During the
Middle Ages, checkpoints were placed on both land and water routes, and the city
of Wasel developed greatly with the revenue from the toll taxes.  For this
reason, the Wasel Bridge is a symbol and something to be proud of for the
citizens of Basel.

A Darcus village that existed in the empire's territory.  It was a small village
surrounded by lush trees, and many of the residents were hunters.  Unusual among
the Darx people, who are good at mechanical technology, As their lifestyle
centered on hunting and gathering, they had almost no interaction with other
Darx villages, and they formed a unique tribe similar to that of a hunting
tribe. He followed the customs of life and lived a modest life.  However, due to
an incident several years ago, it disappeared. Currently, only a few people
remember this village. # #Children, both male and female, are raised as hunters
from an early age and are taught the skills of hunting and gathering.  They do
not use guns for hunting, but use special hunting equipment that combines a bow,
spear, and machete.  This is a unique idea based on village customs, which
states that birds must be killed with a bow, beasts with a spear, and plants
with a machete.In order to carry and use these tools rationally,  This is the
result of repeated improvements.  Since the village disappeared, no hunting
equipment remains.

A white flower of the Asteraceae family that blooms in Tilka Village.  Because
the stems are thin and not resistant to wind and snow, it grows only in special
places such as sunny spots in forests.  If the air and water are not clean, it
will quickly wither. It rarely blooms in areas where humans live, and is prized
and protected by botanists as an endangered species.  Since it cannot be grown
in a pot, it is not suitable for ornamental purposes. # #It has a soft sweet
scent, which bees like.  The flower blooms from early summer to midsummer when
the sun is strong.  The seeds fall in autumn, but because they are sensitive to
changes in the environment, they grow in clusters in roughly the same area every
year.  The roots are used as an analgesic, the leaves as an antipyretic, and the
petals as a fragrance. In Tilka village, it was cherished as a symbol of the
village.  When villagers get married, it is customary to decorate the bride with
eirsh, so  weddings in Tilka Village were limited to summer.

The only military academy in the Principality of Gaul with a 215-year-old
tradition.  The crown of ``Royal'' comes from the fact that Gaul was a monarchy
at the time of its founding. All those who enter the school bear a heavy
responsibility and strong pride in their name and history. It happens.  There
are various training facilities and living facilities within the school.
Although some traces of the time when the school was founded remain, they are
being expanded and renovated one after another.  It is a boarding school, and
the cadets who enter the school live within the school and spend their days
occupied with academic studies and combat training. # #Students study for an
average of 3 years.  Because we use a credit acquisition system, the time it
takes to obtain graduation qualifications varies depending on your ability.  As
a tradition dating back to the days of the monarchy, many of the students are
the sons of aristocrats,  but there are also cases in which people who have
achieved excellent results in military training in junior high and high school
are scouted and enrolled.  In addition to being granted officer qualifications
to graduates, it is also possible to obtain national qualifications as a doctor
or engineer depending on the credits.

A short knife that Riela always carries on her left leg.  The blade is straight
and has no decorations, and the grip is unprocessed.  It seems to be a primitive
item with an old manufacturing date.  Perhaps it has been well taken care of, as
there is almost no rust or chipping of the blade, and it is in good condition. 
However, from the point of view of ease of handling, the shape is inconvenient. 
It's only half-baked for self-defense, hunting, and cooking, and it shows that
it was made in an era before cutlery had been refined according to its purpose.
# #Riera received this knife as a memento from her adopted father who passed
away, her adoptive mother has told her to carry it with her at all times as it
will protect her. .  She calls this her ``talisman knife'' and always carries it
with her.  In addition to carrying around, Riera has learned how to use a knife
for self-defense.  When Kurt called out to Riera for the first time, even though
it was a surprise attack, he acted to intercept her at a speed that made it
impossible for him to react at all.

It is a federal state located on the western side of the continent that was
established by the coming together of countries with a republican system.
Commonly known as ``The Federation.''  In the wake of the industrial revolution
in the late 18th century, many republics were born in western Europe through
citizen revolutions.  For those countries, the huge nation ``Empire'' that was
born in the east  was a threatening existence. Therefore, the Western countries
signed treaties and alliances among themselves, and formed the ``Atlantic
Federation'' to ensure mutual security. # #The ``Atlantic Federal Organization''
is opposed to the ``Union of Eastern European Empires,'' a federated nation
ruled by an emperor. In reality, it is a federation of countries, so their
intentions may intersect. ,  Unanimous opinions within the Federation are rare,
and unity is fragile.  Each country is intricately intertwined with secret
treaties and coercive diplomacy, Although it exceeds the Empire in terms of
overall national power, Unification of will at critical points will be delayed,
so it is important for the Empire to take the lead in all matters. I've been

A port city in southern Gaul, facing the Gallic Sea.  One of Gaul's main ports,
it has prospered as a port town since ancient times.  The old aqueduct that
still remains around the city is a remnant of that.  In modern times, a new
aqueduct with a water wheel was constructed as a canal facility.  Waterwheels
used water power to pull up cargo.  Also, the former aqueduct has been repaired
and is still in use. It can be said that it is a historic city that retains a
good old atmosphere. # #It also functions as a transportation hub in southern
Gaul. National Route 7 is the main road connecting the capital Landgris and
Antholt, and many people come and go.  Due to its existence as a transportation
hub, it has a large population for a regional city. Furthermore, the navigation
of ships brings together a variety of people from Japan and abroad. Although its
culture is Gallic,  nThere are many buildings that give off the scent of foreign
countries.  It is one of the most international cities in Gaul.

Commonly known as "World War I."  The conflicts of interest between the Empire
and the Federation over ragnite resources  triggered a great war that spread
across Europe.  After the industrial revolution that began in the late 18th
century, the demand for ragnite resources increased. The political and economic
conflicts between the Empire and the Federation intensified over ragnite
resources, and the relationship soon became a tense one.  Then, in the early
20th century, war broke out between the two countries due to the assassination
of the Crown Prince of the Empire.  Nearby countries were also involved one
after another. # #In the latter part of World War I, the Imperial Army invaded
the Principality of Gallia, targeting its rich ragnite resources, but General
Bergen Gunther led an armored force of light tanks to fight back.  They
succeeded in successfully repelling the imperial army. \ nGeneral Gunther was
hailed as a hero of Gaul, and his tactics became the basis of military campaigns
in Gaul.  The Empire and the Federation, exhausted by the war of attrition,
concluded an armistice treaty after several years of fighting, and the First
World War came to an end.

A military trial in which Major General Karl Eisler's treason was proven based
on the accusations made by Lieutenant Colonel Ramsay Crowe.  He leaked military
secrets such as the armaments and operational instructions of the Gallic army to
Cardinal Gennaro Borgia of the Yugdian religion,  and also obtained information
about the imperial army and kept it secret.  With the physical evidence
suppressed, Major General Eisler was unable to deny his charges, and was
arrested on the same day. # #The fact that this military trial was completed
relatively smoothly was the result of Commander Crow's efforts to manipulate the
upper echelons of the Gallian army.  Originally, Major General Eisler was a
peacemaker who sought ceasefire negotiations, and was in conflict with the main
war faction, which advocated complete resistance. However, before the Battle of
Naziar, he colluded with General Damon, the main war faction, and decided to
force a total war. Many of the pro-war factions were furious at the promotion of
total war, the most foolish of all plans, and they accepted Commander Crowe's
request for a military trial.

After Eisler's arrest, Nameless was treated as a regular unit of the Gallic
Regular Army, and the members' names and ranks were restored.  As a result,
there was temporarily no unit in charge of special missions in the Gallian army.
After the war, this matter was discussed at the headquarters, and the necessity
of special forces and the pros and cons of punitive forces were questioned. 
Although it was not a system that received much praise, it was highly praised
for its usefulness. # #Nameless's immediate superior, Lieutenant Colonel Ramsay
Crowe, said: They fought not to escape execution by firing squad, but for honor
and the great cause of national defense. pointing out.  He argued that a new
special forces unit should be established, not as a punitive unit, but as a
proud unit that is the cornerstone of national defense.  Although Lieutenant
Colonel Crow's plan is the most likely at the moment, there are opposing
opinions that it is not realistic due to the serious shortage of human resources
in the Regular Army.  As of now, there is no successor to the nameless strongest

A historical event in which Cordelia Guy Landgrise, who became the Grand Duke of
Gallia, confessed to the people that she was a Darcusian after the Armistice
Treaty was signed between the Principality of Gallia and the Empire.  During the
ancient Valkyrian War, the Darxian hero Landgrise defected to the Valkyrians and
was given the rule of Gaul. Since then, he has ruled by lying about his
bloodline as a descendant of the Valkyrians.  This was the true history that had
been kept hidden. # #It goes without saying that Archduke Cordelia's declaration
shocked the people.  However, the Grand Duke's sincere attitude and discarding
that lie, and his strong will to aim for a harmonious society where people can
live without discrimination, gained great support from the people.  Since then,
Archduke Cordelia has become a symbol of post-war reconstruction and peace in
Gaul.  On the other hand, there are many people among the aristocracy and people
with anti-Darcus views who are dissatisfied with the current situation.

Imperial forces captured the Basel Bridge on April 5th.  The Gauls retreated to
the west bank of the Basel River.  In response, in the early hours of April
14th, the Gallic regular army carried out a bold and precise operation, crossing
the Basel River in tanks and attacking the enemy camp from behind.  The
unexpected surprise attack caused the imperial army to lose its will to fight,
and they fell into chaos, including falling from the Vasel Bridge into the
river. # #Galian military authorities have continued to announce that they are
confident in their counteroffensive operations, and this latest achievement has
brilliantly proven that.  The imperial army's momentum has completely stopped,
and they are reeling from their defeat.  The Gallic army, now with a chance of
victory, decided to go on the offensive. \ nGeneral Damon, commander of the
Central Gallic Army,\ n now is the time to take down the enemy in a spirit of
national unity, and he urges all his forces to do so,\ n showing a strong will
for victory.
--------------------------------
[00000704]
Thanks to the efforts of the volunteer army, the Basel Bridge was recaptured! 
In an offensive that appears to be part of the Gallic Army's counteroffensive
strategy against the Empire's invasion, the 3rd Company of the Gallic Volunteer
Army recaptured Vasel Bridge, a key transportation point in Gaul, on the 14th. 
By repelling the imperial army that had occupied this land, Landgriz was
released from the danger of blockading the capital. # #When the volunteer army
took back the Basel Bridge, instead of attacking the strong bridgehead, they
carried out a bold and unique strategy of crossing the Basel River with tanks
and attacking from behind. Some of the imperial forces were caught by surprise.
It was a huge mess.  The captain of the 7th platoon of the 3rd company of the
volunteer army, which took command of the river crossing operation Second
Lieutenant Welkin Gunther (22) is the eldest son of the late General Bergen
Gunther, a hero of World War I. The new It is hoped that the appearance of a new
hero will raise fighting spirit.
--------------------------------
[00000705]
It appears that the Imperial Army, which has retreated from the Basel Bridge,
will abandon its attempt to forcibly break through to the capital, Landgriz, and
advance its forces into northern and southern Gaul.  As a result, the front
lines of both armies extended from Fausen in the north, to Athlone City in the
center, and to Kroden in the south, making expansion of the battlefield
inevitable.  Military authorities say that a special unit of the Gallic regular
army engaged the Imperial Army, and drove out the Imperial Army troops stationed
in Athlon City.  It was announced that they had achieved the second victory
after the victory at Basel Bridge. # #There were imperial troops scattered
around Athlon City, and it was thought that it would be difficult to capture it.
However, our army, which has an advantage in geographical information, quickly
discovered the enemy's forces and launched an attack that overwhelmed them. 
Military authorities took the view that this was a victory for defensive tactics
that took advantage of the terrain and maneuverability cultivated in World War
I, and that the counter-offensive operation was a success.

Second Lieutenant Welkin Gunther of the 7th Platoon, 3rd Company of the
Volunteer Army discovered a new species of insect while scouting an Imperial
Army position.  Second Lieutenant Gunther's name is ``Midrimamehanmyou.''  It is
said to be an insect of the family Prunidae.  The body length is about 1 cm, and
it is a small insect about the size of a fingertip.  The fact that it was found
on kudzu leaves suggests that it feeds primarily on these leaves.  # #It is
reported that the green bean-bean, which Ensign Gunther sketched himself, had an
impressive vermilion compound eye.  It looks similar to longhorn beetles, but
its color ranges from dark blue to jet black, and it is said to be a distinctly
different species from longhorn beetles.  According to the Lieutenant's
observation, there appears to be an organ in the buttocks that emits light, but
no luminescence has been confirmed yet.  There seems to be a theory that his
organs may have degenerated.

On the 20th, military authorities announced the withdrawal of the Gallic Army's
northern garrison.  This is because Fausen, the largest defense base in the
north, has been captured.  The area is home to ragnite mines, refineries, and
heavy chemical factories such as steel and oil refineries.  The second-largest
defense force after the capital, Landgriz, was stationed here, but it fell under
attack by an overwhelmingly large force led by Imperial Army General Berhold
Gregor.  Domestic production capacity is expected to take a major hit. # #An
emergency meeting of the military headquarters was held on the evening of the
same day that news of the occupation by the Imperial Army was reported, but it
seems that there is no concrete prospect of retaking northern Gaul.  There are
reports of sightings of large numbers of refugees from Fausen heading south . 
Meanwhile, the miners have been captured by the Imperial Army, and are said to
be held captive in mines across the north.

[00000709]
Herbert Dolman, a painter who defected from the country that was once called the
Kingdom of Filard, held a solo exhibition at Landgriz.  The former Kingdom of
Filard, once an artistic powerhouse, produced many masters who left their names
in European history, painters and sculptors known as geniuses.  The reason for
this is that all people were familiar with the arts from an early age, and were
taught by excellent instructors. # #The historic people of Gaul have had a long
history of interaction with this country of art, and have been greatly
influenced not only economically but also culturally.  Therefore, the same
people's awareness regarding art is common.  In place of the fallen Kingdom of
Philaldo, the Principality of Gaul must lead the culture of Europe.  Also, Mr.
Dolman said that holding a solo exhibition during the war was a message for
peace,  that a nation with its traditions and excellent art should not be
destroyed.

Ragnite ore, which is produced as a mineral resource, can be used as energy for
various purposes depending on the refining method.  Refined into liquid form,
``Lagunarin'' is used as a source of light such as lamps and outdoor lights, as
well as a power source for vehicles, and as a source of energy for daily life. 
In recent years, it has been discovered that Ragnite has a component that acts
on the human body and has an analgesic effect, and ``Laguna Aid'' has been
developed, which reacts with Ragnite and provides a bactericidal and recovery
effect to the subject. # #The Faculty of Agriculture at Landgriz University
applied the effects of Laguna Aid and invented a new type of chemical fertilizer
that has both insect repellent and soil revitalizing effects.  It has passed
safety tests for its effects on soil and crops,  and has now been put into
practical use.  It is said that it will be available in stores from next month

In the imperial territory adjacent to eastern Gaul, the Imperial Army's supply
base was destroyed by someone.  The cause is unknown. Experts familiar with the
affairs of the Empire believe that this was the work of anti-war activists
within the Empire.  The Empire side has issued a statement condemning this as an
act of invasion by the Gallic army,  appealing to public opinion.  However, this
is groundless and is an open defamation of our country. # #Military authorities
deny the Empire's statement.  The battle in Gaul, which is a neutral nation, was
a battle for defense,  and it was announced that fighting outside the country
would be a violation of the neutrality treaty and would be unfeasible. 
Currently, the Gallic army is fighting hard to maintain its domestic front There
is no way it can attack outside the country.  An act of invasion by a brave man
who rose up for the sake of national defense is impossible.  The people must be
careful not to be fooled by the Empire's information manipulation.

What is presumed to be the relics of the Valkyrians has been excavated from the
ruins of the Barias Desert.  Relics said to have been used by the ancient
Valkyrians have been excavated from all over the European continent, but the one
unearthed this time is a spiral relief called the ``Valkyria Spiral.''  As it
has a unique shape and its purpose is unknown, it is thought to be a decorative
craft. # #Valkyria's Spiral is said to be a symbol of Valkyria's infinite power.
The inscription states that the Valkyrians fought with holy power that shines
blue , and the murals in the ruins depict them fighting with spiral-shaped
spears and shields.   Archaeological researchers have suggested that there may
be some connection between the reliefs and the murals,  but the details have not
been determined.

It appears that the Imperial Army is planning a major reorganization of its
forces in mid-July.  According to military authorities, some soldiers from
various areas will be assembled at Fortress Ghirlandaio, the headquarters of the
Imperial Army, and a new unit will be formed.  It is unclear at this time
whether this will be used as a defensive force, or whether it will be deployed
as a new attack force to the northern or central front. I am concerned about
trends. # #Meanwhile, the Gallic army sensed that there was no movement in
Central Gallia, where the front line was stagnant, taking advantage of this
opportunity as the enemy forces across the front lines were decreasing.  It
appears that they will start advancing towards the north.  There are still
strong Imperial forces remaining in the north,  and a force centered on the
Gallic regular army has been assembled to cut them down.  The command has high
hopes that this northern attack plan will pave the way to retaking Fausen.

visit of the Federation Ambassador.  In that conversation, Prime Minister Borg
emphasized that seeking a system of cooperation with the Federation was the most
important task for Gaul's survival.  The prime minister will continue to hold
talks with the ambassador.  The first visit was nothing more than confirming the
positive attitudes of both parties, and it seems that there were occasional
smiles in the conversation. # #After shaking hands firmly with Prime Minister
Borg, the Federation Ambassador said with a smile, ``The Federation side and
Gaul are on the same page, without having to compromise.''  The Prime Minister's
diplomatic skills are attracting attention from all walks of life as to whether
they will be effective in the fight against the Empire.

On the 28th, the conferment ceremony for the Order of the Principality, which is
awarded to those recognized for their special service to the country, was held
in the audience hall of Landgris Castle.  This time, the recipient of the Order
of Merit of the Principality was Second Lieutenant Welkin Gunther (22), a member
of the volunteer army.  Princess Cordelia handed Ensign Gunter a medal with a
motif of the legendary creature, the unicorn, and with her words of
congratulations, ``I look forward to your continued loyalty to Gaul.'' # #After
the investiture ceremony, Second Lieutenant Gunther appeared wearing his medal
and told the assembled reporters. ``I am determined to continue working even
harder after receiving this honor.''  In addition, the late General Bergen
Gunther, the hero of World War I and the real father of Second Lieutenant Welkin
Gunther, also received the Order of the Principality in the past. This is a
memorable award for two generations of father and son. It became.

There are rumors that there is an internal conflict within the Gallic army. 
According to information obtained from a certain Gallian regular army soldier,
there is a unit that will sortie into southern Gallia, where the Imperial Army
has already retreated.   Currently, the central and northern areas are the main
battlefields, there are no extra troops, so why are regular army units heading
to the south?  A reporter from this newspaper also headed to the south to
conduct an interview. # #As a result of the interview, we found out that the
number of troops dispatched to the south was greater than expected.  It's
clearly not a warning.  There is a possibility that Imperial Army troops are
hiding, but in that case, one of the cities, towns, and villages would have been
damaged.  Also, recently there was a revision to military regulations, and the
existence of troops that have received severe punishment has been made public. 
From this, it seems that there was an internal conflict within the military, but
what is the truth?

A comfort concert was held at the Gallic military base Amatrian.  The event
centered on female singers active in Japan,  performing songs expressing their
wishes for peace and their condolences for the victims of war.  Some of the
performers lost their families and loved ones in the war,  and their poignant
voices calling out for the lives lost could be heard from inside the venue, but 
nThe soldiers' will to win would have become stronger and firmer. # #The event
also featured a mini-live stage performed by soldiers, which turned into a
singing contest featuring beautiful voices.  The soldiers brought their favorite
songs and performed their songs,  some of which were ``Fuck the Empire!'' Some
people even laughed as they improvised.  The star of such a friendly stage was
Miss Brigitte Stark of the volunteer army's 3rd company, 7th platoon. When she
sang the Gallic national anthem solo without accompaniment, the venue fell
silent, and at the end there was thunderous applause.
--------------------------------
[00000742]
What is the unexpected boom among soldiers?  Gaulia will soon celebrate the
Spirit Festival.  It looks like the atmosphere will be more solemn than usual
for the Spirit Festival, which is celebrated amidst the flames of war.  The most
popular gift among Gallic soldiers is said to be an amulet.  You could say it's
a boom typical of soldiers fighting for their lives. # #Meanwhile, among
ordinary people, practical items such as water, food, medicine, etc. that can be
useful in emergencies are becoming popular.  In previous years, shoes, clothing,
and precious metals were popular, but this year sales have been slow due to
shortages and practical items.  In the shops where quiet birds are chirping,
``If only there were no war...''  The murmurs mixed with sighs echoed forlornly.

Military authorities announced that they had successfully recaptured Fausen. 
The Gallic regular army and the volunteer army jointly attacked the northern
industrial area,   completely driving out the imperial army garrison and
liberating the area.  Although the majority of the Imperial forces have begun to
retreat, some still continue to resist.  In order to wipe out the remaining
troops, the military launches a pursuit operation, ``White Horse.''  Aiming for
the complete liberation of northwestern Gaul. # #The decisive victory in the
battle at Fausen was the destruction of the armored train Asel.  Eser is
equipped with a large number of armaments, including a powerful train cannon,
and is also the mobile command center of Major General Berhold Gregor, the
commander who protects Fausen.  The Gallic army blows up the viaduct while Ezel
is driving over the valley.  Azel fell to the bottom of the ravine.  It seems
that Major General Gregor also shared Ezel's fate.

Second Lieutenant Faldio Lanzarto, commander of the 1st Platoon of the 3rd
Company of Volunteer Forces, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.  2nd
Lieutenant Lanzert is suspected of sniping and attempting to kill an allied
soldier at a Gallic army base during the Battle of Nazial.  The deciding factor
in his arrest was that the bullet he used was a special bullet from a new sniper
rifle being developed by the Gallian army, and was not commonly available. #
#The victim was temporarily in a critical condition, but she is currently
recovering.  When questioned by the military police, Suspect Ranzert remained
silent about his motive, but since he was acquainted with the victim, it seems
likely that he was involved in a sexual affair or that he was a spy for the
Imperial Army. The investigation is being conducted from this point of view. 
Those who knew the suspect said, ``He had a cheerful and sociable personality. I
can't believe he would do something like this.''

Before the capture of Ghirlandaio Fortress, the Gallic army is shaken.  The
commanding officer, Major General Karl Eisler, was arrested and court-martialed.
The crime has been announced as an unforgivable treason against the state, but
the circumstances and details are currently under investigation.  The military
authorities' press conference was held in a cautious manner from beginning to
end, and was ended after a very short period of time. # #The only reason why
this incident was made public  was because the military said, ``This is a sign
of remorse so that such a mistake will never happen again.''  While the
situation is viewed as extremely serious, it is assumed that the authorities
have not yet grasped the full extent of this incident.  It is emphasized that
there will be no problems with the capture of Ghirlandaio Fortress .  An attack
is expected to take place soon.
--------------------------------
[00000758]
With the retreat of the Imperial Army to Fortress Ghirlandaio, people who had
fled the war and evacuated to the south began to return to their various places.
Following the cities in the south where reconstruction has already begun, groups
of people returning to cities in the north and central region are crowding the
streets.  Although the battle is still ongoing, rebuilding one's life is also a
battle. # #Currently, people trying to return from the evacuation area are
coming to the capital Landgriz, but Princess Cordelia has called on the people
to be cautious and ordered nearby cities and towns to stand by.  The war isn't
over yet, and if the Imperial Army has anything to aim for, the princess says,
they'll definitely come after Landgriz. In her eyes, I saw a strong sense of
responsibility towards the nation that I had never seen before, as well as her
will as a leader.  The evacuees seem to be following the princess's instructions
and waiting for the war to end.

We bring you a follow-up report on the mysterious unit that we exclusively
scooped the other day.  A war correspondent of this newspaper who continues to
work on the battlefield saw a black-clad unit that appeared to be them at Fort
Ghirlandaio.  It appears that a single platoon has attacked the fortress.  As we
continued our research, we were able to get closer to the true identity of this
unit, albeit a little. # #Judging from the attack on the fortress, there is no
doubt that they are former soldiers of the Gallic army.  The circumstances
leading up to this point are not clear, but according to information from
military sources, they were the units that defended the capital, Landgriz, when
it was attacked.  Regarding the raid on Landgriz, the military had been
controlling information, but it looks like that will be lifted as well.  The
facts should become clear little by little.

section of a huge land battleship, but was unable to stop it and allowed it to
enter the capital.  The capital defense battalion has been destroyed, Landgriz
Castle has been partially destroyed, and  Prime Minister Borg has been found
dead.  In response, the 7th Platoon of the 3rd Company of the Volunteer Army,
led by Second Lieutenant Welkin Gunther, defeats the Imperial Army detachment at
Wasel Bridge and heads out to recapture Landgriz. # #In order to intercept this,
the Imperial Army Commander, Sub-Prince Maximilian, takes a huge land battleship
to the Landgriz Road.  After a fierce battle, the 7th Platoon destroyed a huge
land battleship of the Imperial Army.  It was a great success in that Crown
Prince Maximilian was also killed in battle.  With the commander-in-chief killed
in action, the Empire no longer wishes to continue the fighting, and it is
expected that negotiations will begin toward an armistice.

Cardinal Gennaro Borgia of the Yugdian religion was found murdered.  The Yggdian
Church announced yesterday that Cardinal Borgia was kidnapped and murdered by an
anti-Ygdish group of Darcians while on his way to travel abroad.  Bad news has
been delivered across the continent.  It is said that there are many Darxian
rebel organizations within the Empire, which appear to be trying to make extreme
demands against the government.  However, the Darcian side denies this
announcement and is poised to protest. # #Cardinal Borgia is known as a man of
great character, despite his high rank, he has carried out the most energetic
missionary work.  It is well known that he is rarely in his room at the
headquarters of the Yugdo cult, and spends most of the year campaigning abroad. 
This year, the Federation has expressed its strong regret over the war with
Gaul, and has crossed the border many times in order to find a path to peace
between the countries.  I would like to express my condolences to the wise man
who lived for peace.

Cordelia Guy Landgrise, the head of the Landgrise family who ascended the throne
as Grand Duke, denied her lineage as a descendant of the Valkyrians and
announced that she was a Darxian.  The contents shocked many of the people, The
princess's sincere attitude and strong will to aim for reconciliation beyond
race, the fear of the downfall of the Landgris family that was originally
predicted was different. On the contrary, it gained great support from the
people. # #This declaration is expected to improve the status of the Darcus
people.  Already, many people from all over the country come to the capital to
catch a glimpse of Grand Duke Cordelia. The Grand Duke also shows off his indigo
hair. From the spire of the renovated Castle of Landgriz. waving to the people. 
However, some nobles are reluctant to accept this drastic change, and believers
of the Yggd religion also seem to have mixed feelings.  There is a mixture of
expectation and anxiety about how the Grand Duke will lead this country.
--------------------------------
[00000770]
The war ended with the efforts of the volunteer army's 3rd Company and 7th
Platoon The Gallic Campaign ended, but even after that, Grand Duke Cordelia Guy
Landgrise, who was considered a descendant of the Valkyrians, represented
herself as a Darcian. It seems that the country is still in a state of hectic
activity, such as the announcement.  The Archduke's Darcusian declaration is
causing various ripples in various quarters.  It is said that among the
Dalxians, who can be said to be involved, there is a welcoming mood,  as well as
concerns about a backlash. # #In fact, there are conservative factions among
some of the nobles who are not happy with the Grand Duke's declaration.  Now
that we know that they are not Valkyrians, does the Landgrise family have any
legitimacy to rule Gaul?  For the aristocrats who value status and formality,
there is no doubt that this was a declaration that fundamentally rejected the
state system.  Grand Duke Cordelia aims for a new Gaul, and traditions and
history that continue from ancient times.  I would like to pay attention to how
they will come to terms with this.
